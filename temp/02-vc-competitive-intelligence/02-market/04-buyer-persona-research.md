### Responsibilities & Daily Workflow

**Core Responsibilities**:

**1. Research Operations (40% of time)**

- Define competitive research frameworks and templates
- Manage research tool stack (PitchBook, Crunchbase, CB Insights, AlphaSense)
- Train analysts on research methodologies
- Quality-check competitive intelligence briefs before partner review

**2. Process Optimization (25% of time)**

- Identify bottlenecks in investment workflow (sourcing → screening → diligence → IC)
- Evaluate and implement new tools/platforms to improve efficiency
- Build internal knowledge management systems (Notion, Airtable, internal wikis)

**3. Data Analytics & Reporting (20% of time)**

- Produce quarterly portfolio performance reports
- Market mapping and trend analysis (identify emerging sectors, track deal flow)
- Investment committee materials (market sizing, competitive landscapes, benchmarking)

**4. Team Management (15% of time)**

- Hire and develop analysts/associates
- Conduct performance reviews, career development
- Allocate research workload across team members

**Typical Week**:

| Day | Activities |
|-----|-----------|
| **Monday** | Team standup (allocate research projects for week), review IC materials for Tuesday meeting |
| **Tuesday** | Attend Investment Committee (present competitive intelligence for 2-3 companies) |
| **Wednesday** | Tool vendor meetings (evaluate new platforms), 1:1s with analysts |
| **Thursday** | Deep work: market mapping projects, data analysis, process documentation |
| **Friday** | Quality review of analyst research, planning for next week's IC |

**Pain Points in Current Workflow**:

- **Analyst Bottleneck**: 2-5 analysts can't keep up with 200-400 company evaluations/year (competitive research backlog)
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Junior analysts produce surface-level research; senior analysts too busy for routine competitive intelligence
- **Tool Sprawl**: Manages 10-12 research tools ($90K-165K annual budget) but no integrated synthesis platform
- **Reactive Mode**: Spends 60-70% of time responding to partner ad-hoc research requests vs. proactive market intelligence

**Customer Quote** (Director of Research at $600M early-stage VC):

> "I manage a team of three analysts who are constantly overwhelmed. Partners ask for competitive intelligence with 24-48 hour turnaround, but thorough research takes 3-4 hours per company. I'm constantly triaging - which companies get deep research vs. surface-level analysis? We need a force multiplier to maintain quality while scaling our deal flow. If I could automate the standardized parts of competitive research, my analysts could focus on strategic questions that require human judgment."

| Budget Range | Approval Required | Decision Timeline |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **<$10K/year** | Director discretion (no approval needed) | 1-2 weeks |
| **$10K-50K/year** | Managing Partner approval (informal) | 4-6 weeks |
| **$50K-100K/year** | Managing Partner + CFO approval | 6-8 weeks |
| **>$100K/year** | Full partnership vote | 8-12 weeks |

**Our Sweet Spot**: $30K-50K annual subscription (Managing Partner approval only, 6-8 week sales cycle)

**Decision Criteria** (Ranked by Importance):

**1. ROI Validation (50% weighting)**

- **Metric**: Time savings per competitive analysis (must achieve 40-60% reduction from 2-3 hours to 45-60 minutes)
- **Proof Requirement**: Freemium pilot with 5-10 analyses to benchmark against manual research
- **Calculation**: 300 companies/year × 1.5 hours saved × $75/hour analyst cost = $33,750 annual savings vs. $40K subscription cost → **ROI = 84% payback in Year 1**

### Role in Purchase Decision

**Influence Type**: **Approver + Champion**

**Why Partners Care About Competitive Intelligence Automation**:

**Pain Point 1: Trust Deficit in Analyst Research**

- Partners don't trust junior analyst research quality (inconsistent, surface-level)
- Partners spend 30-60 minutes reviewing/re-doing competitive analysis before IC
- **Automation Value**: Standardized framework ensures minimum quality bar → partners spend less time reviewing, more time making decisions

**Pain Point 2: Missed Investment Opportunities Due to Slow Research**

- Competitive deals move fast (1-2 week decision window)
- Partners pass on deals because "we don't have time to do proper diligence"
- **Automation Value**: 24-48 hour turnaround on comprehensive competitive intelligence → enables partners to compete for fast-moving deals

**Pain Point 3: Competitive Blind Spots Hurt Portfolio Performance**

- Partners make investments with incomplete competitive landscape (missed new entrants, adjacent threats)
- Portfolio companies fail due to "underestimated competition" (40% of startup failures [CB Insights, 2024])
- **Automation Value**: Multi-source synthesis reduces competitive blind spots → better investment decisions

**Decision Involvement**:

| Stage | Partner Role | Influence Level |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Awareness** | Director of Research mentions tool, partners provide input on pain points | Low (passive) |
| **Evaluation** | Partners review pilot outputs (5-10 competitive intelligence reports) | **High (quality check)** |
| **Purchase Decision** | Managing Partner approves budget ($30K-50K) | **Critical (approval required)** |
| **Post-Purchase** | Partners use platform for IC preparation, provide feedback | Medium (adoption driver) |

**Customer Quote** (Managing Partner at $450M multi-stage VC):

> "Our Director of Research proposed this competitive intelligence tool. I was skeptical - we already pay $150K/year for PitchBook, Crunchbase, CB Insights. But when I reviewed the pilot outputs, I realized this solves a different problem. Those tools give us data. This gives us analysis. If it saves our analysts 50% of their time and produces partner-quality competitive intelligence, it's worth $40K/year. That's 80% cheaper than hiring another analyst."

---

### Role in Purchase Decision

**Influence Type**: **End User + Advocate (if product works well)**

**Why Analysts Care About Competitive Intelligence Automation**:

**Benefit 1: Time Savings → Career Development**

- Analysts spend 40-60% of time on commoditized research (competitor identification, market sizing)
- Automation frees time for high-value work (customer interviews, deep-dive technology analysis, investment thesis development)
- **Career Impact**: Analysts who deliver strategic insights (not just data) get promoted faster

**Benefit 2: Quality Consistency → Reduced Partner Criticism**

- Junior analysts fear partners rejecting research as "incomplete" or "surface-level"
- Standardized framework ensures all competitive analyses meet minimum quality bar
- **Stress Reduction**: Less anxiety about "did I miss a competitor?" or "is my market sizing credible?"

**Benefit 3: Learning Accelerator → Skill Development**

- Seeing AI-generated competitive analyses helps junior analysts learn what "good" looks like
- Analysts can study framework (how to structure positioning maps, how to validate market sizing)
- **Skill Building**: Automation as teaching tool, not replacement

**Objections from Analysts**:

**Objection 1: "Will automation make my role obsolete?"**

- **Frequency**: 45% of analyst end users raise this concern
- **Response**: "Automation handles commoditized tasks; you focus on strategic analysis that gets you promoted"
- **Adoption Driver**: Show career progression path (analyst → associate → principal requires strategic skills, not data entry)

**Objection 2: "I don't trust AI - I prefer doing research myself"**

- **Frequency**: 30% of analyst end users (especially those with consulting backgrounds)
- **Response**: "Use automation as starting point, then customize/refine - you're still the analyst, AI is the research assistant"
- **Adoption Driver**: Position as "human-in-the-loop" tool, not autonomous black box

**Customer Quote** (Senior Associate at $800M growth equity firm):

> "I was worried this tool would make my job redundant. But after using it for 2 months, I realize it's the opposite. I used to spend 60-70% of my time on boring research (who are the competitors, what's the market size). Now I spend 60-70% of my time on strategic questions (can this company defend against competitors, is the team strong enough to out-execute). That's the work that gets me promoted to Principal, not manually searching Crunchbase."
