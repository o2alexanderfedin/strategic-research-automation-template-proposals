## Executive Summary

The go-to-market (GTM) strategy targets **mid-size venture capital firms** ($100M-2B AUM) with a **freemium pilot model** designed to demonstrate value before asking for payment commitment. The strategy leverages VC-specific channels (LinkedIn, industry conferences, referral networks) and emphasizes speed-to-value (2-4 week pilots) to overcome typical enterprise SaaS friction.

**Core GTM Principles**:
1. **Product-Led Growth**: Free pilots drive acquisition (no sales-led friction)
2. **Value-First Selling**: Demonstrate 40-60% time savings before discussing pricing
3. **Community-Driven**: Leverage VC networks and referrals for credibility
4. **Vertical-Specific**: Tailored messaging for VC workflow (not generic business intelligence)

**Revenue Model**:
- **Freemium Pilot**: 2-4 weeks, 5-10 competitive briefs, no credit card required
- **Annual Subscription**: $30K-50K for unlimited basic briefs
- **Usage-Based Add-Ons**: $500-1K per deep-dive analysis, $10K-20K for portfolio monitoring

**Customer Acquisition Targets (Year 1)**:
- **Q1-Q2 (Weeks 1-12)**: 10-20 VC firm customers, $300K-800K ARR
- **Q3-Q4**: 40-80 customers, $1.2M-3.2M ARR

## Pricing & Packaging Strategy

```markdown
| Tier | Annual Price | Monthly Price | Target Customer | Key Features | Limits |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **Startup** | $30,000 ($2,500/mo equivalent) | $3,000/mo | Small VCs<br/>(10-20 professionals) | • Unlimited basic briefs<br/>• 50 deep-dives/year<br/>• Email support<br/>• PDF export | • 1 CRM integration<br/>• 10 users max |
| **Growth** | $50,000 ($4,167/mo equivalent) | $5,000/mo | Mid-size VCs<br/>(20-40 professionals) | • Unlimited basic briefs<br/>• 100 deep-dives/year<br/>• CRM integration (Affinity or Salesforce)<br/>• Slack support<br/>• Quarterly reviews | • 2 CRM integrations<br/>• 30 users max |

```

**Usage-Based Add-Ons**:
- **Deep-Dive Analysis**: $500-1,000 per comprehensive report (15-20 pages)
- **Portfolio Monitoring**: $10K-20K/year for ongoing competitive tracking across portfolio
- **Custom Integration**: $15K-30K one-time (e.g., integrate with proprietary deal management system)

**Early Adopter Incentives** (First 20 Customers):
- **20% discount** for annual prepayment (saves $6K-10K)
- **Free portfolio monitoring** for first 6 months ($5K-10K value)
- **Locked-in pricing** for 2 years (no annual increases)

**Payment Terms**:
- **Annual Prepayment**: 20% discount (preferred)
- **Quarterly Billing**: Net 30 terms (standard)
- **Monthly Billing**: +10% premium (for cash-constrained startups)

### Pricing Psychology & Optimization

**Anchoring Strategy**:
- Lead with **Growth Tier** ($50K) as "most popular" option
- Position **Startup Tier** ($30K) as entry point for smaller firms
- Use **Enterprise Tier** ($100K+) as anchor to make Growth seem reasonable

**Packaging Insights**:
- **"Unlimited Basic Briefs"**: Removes usage anxiety (VCs can request as many as needed)
- **"Deep-Dive Quota"**: Encourages upsells (customers exceed quota, pay for add-ons)
- **"CRM Integration"**: Bundled in Growth tier (not add-on) to drive upsell from Startup

**Price Sensitivity Analysis** (Based on Pilot Feedback):
- **High Willingness to Pay**: If platform saves 200+ hours annually (analyst time > $50K value)
- **Medium Willingness**: If platform saves 100-200 hours annually ($25K-50K value)
- **Low Willingness**: If platform saves <100 hours annually (<$25K value)

**Action**: For customers in "Low Willingness" segment, offer **Startup Tier** ($30K) or **usage-based model** ($500 per report, no subscription).
