## Week 6-7: Active Pilot & Rapid Iteration

### Objectives
Execute pilot program with intensive monitoring and rapid iteration based on real-time feedback.

### Key Activities

**1. Usage Monitoring Dashboard** (Continuous)

**Real-Time Metrics Tracked**:

| Metric | Target | Action if Below Target |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **Active Users** | 70%+ of team | Identify barriers (onboarding, complexity)<br/>Offer additional training |
| **Reports Generated** | 3-5 per week per firm | Proactive outreach: "Need help with anything?" |

**Early Warning Signals** (Require Immediate Intervention):
- **Zero reports generated after 1 week**: Schedule call to diagnose issues
- **Quality ratings <3.0 / 5.0**: Manual review of low-quality reports, iterate prompts
- **Support tickets >5 per week per customer**: Product UX issues, prioritize fixes

**2. Structured Feedback Collection** (Weeks 6 & 8)

**Mid-Pilot Feedback Session (Week 6)** (30 minutes):

**Feedback Framework**:
```
Part 1: Usage & Value Assessment (10 min)
1. How many competitive briefs have you generated so far?

4. Can you share a specific example where the report was valuable?

Part 2: Report Quality Deep Dive (10 min)
5. Rate the quality of each section (1-5 scale):

```

**Feedback Analysis Process**:
1. **Aggregate Ratings**: Calculate average quality score across all pilot customers
2. **Identify Patterns**: Common feature requests, recurring complaints, consistent gaps
3. **Prioritize Improvements**: Rank by frequency (how many customers request) × impact (criticality)
4. **Rapid Iteration**: Implement top 3-5 improvements within 1 week

**3. Product Iteration Sprints** (Weeks 6-7)

**Iteration Cadence**: Weekly micro-sprints to address pilot feedback

**Week 6 Iteration Example**:

**Feedback Received**:
- "Competitor identification misses smaller, niche players" (3/3 customers)
- "Positioning maps don't reflect our industry's key dimensions" (2/3 customers)
- "Need more detail on go-to-market strategy comparison" (2/3 customers)

**Prioritization**:
1. **Competitor identification** (High Priority): Add manual competitor suggestions feature
2. **Positioning maps** (Medium Priority): Allow custom dimension selection
3. **GTM analysis** (Medium Priority): Expand report template to include pricing models, sales channels

**Implementation Plan**:
```
Day 1-2: Competitor Identification Enhancement
- Add "Suggest Additional Competitor" button in report viewer
- User can add company name → system fetches data → appends to report
- Store user-suggested competitors to improve ML model

Day 3-4: Custom Positioning Dimensions
- Add dropdown in report request form: "Select positioning axes"
- Pre-populate with industry-standard dimensions (e.g., "Enterprise vs. SMB", "Price")
- Allow custom text input for unique dimensions

Day 5-6: GTM Analysis Expansion
- Update report template to include new section: "Go-to-Market Comparison"
- Extract pricing data from company websites (web scraping)
- Identify sales model (self-serve vs. enterprise sales) from job postings

Day 7: Deploy and Re-Test
- Push updates to staging environment
- Test with pilot customers
- Collect feedback on improvements
```

    if citation_coverage < 0.8:
        quality_issues.append({
            "severity": "low",
            "issue": "Insufficient citations",
            "action": "Add source links for uncited claims"
        })

    # Check 4: Report completeness
    if report.word_count < 3000:
        quality_issues.append({
            "severity": "high",
            "issue": "Report too short (lacks detail)",
            "action": "Expand analysis sections"
        })

    # If critical issues, hold report for manual review
    if any(issue["severity"] == "high" for issue in quality_issues):

- **LTV** (3-year retention): $120K
- **CAC**: $28,500 / 1 = $28,500 per customer
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: 4.2x (Acceptable, but requires commercial sales improvement)

**Scenario 3: Weak Pilot (0/3 Convert)**
- **Revenue**: $0
- **Learning Value**: Invaluable (prevents scaling a product without PMF)
- **Pivot Decision**: Re-evaluate value proposition, target customer, or product direction

## Post-Pilot Action Plan

### If Pilot Succeeds (80%+ Conversion)

**Immediate Actions** (Week 9):
- [ ] Formalize pilot customers as paying contracts
- [ ] Publish 2-3 case studies with customer testimonials
- [ ] Begin outreach to next 20 prospect VCs (leverage case studies)
- [ ] Prioritize top 3 feature requests from pilot feedback
- [ ] Hire Customer Success Manager to support growing customer base

**Week 10-12 Actions**:
- [ ] Scale commercial sales (target 5-10 new paying customers)
- [ ] Implement prioritized feature improvements
- [ ] Expand data sources based on pilot feedback
- [ ] Build referral program (pilot customers refer peers)

### If Pilot Underperforms (0-33% Conversion)

**Diagnostic Process**:
1. **Product-Market Fit Assessment**: Was the problem real? Did our solution solve it?
2. **Quality Analysis**: Did reports meet VC standards? What specific gaps?
3. **Pricing Evaluation**: Was price point reasonable? Would lower price have changed decision?
4. **Competitive Landscape**: Did alternative solutions emerge? Are VCs building in-house?

**Potential Pivots**:
- **Pivot 1: Human-in-the-Loop Model**: Hybrid AI + analyst review for higher quality
- **Pivot 2: Different Target Customer**: PE firms instead of VCs (deeper diligence, higher budget)
- **Pivot 3: Different Use Case**: Portfolio monitoring instead of deal flow screening
- **Pivot 4: Unbundled Offering**: Sell individual components (competitor ID, market sizing) separately

**Go/No-Go Decision Criteria**:
- **Go**: If 1+ customer converts AND quality issues are fixable AND customers express strong interest
- **No-Go**: If 0 conversions AND quality concerns are fundamental AND customers don't see value even with improvements

## Key Insights & Best Practices

### Pilot Program Lessons from Adjacent Markets

**Insight 1: VCs Value Speed Over Perfection**
- **Source**: Interviews with VC platform tool vendors (Affinity, Carta)
- **Implication**: Prioritize <2 min report generation over exhaustive competitor lists
- **Action**: Optimize for fast "good enough" briefs, offer "deep-dive" option for comprehensive analysis

**Insight 2: VC Firms Have High Tool Churn**
- **Source**: "The State of VC Tech Stack 2024" report
- **Data**: 40% of VC tools are replaced within 18 months

- **Action**: Implement quarterly value reviews (time saved, reports used, decisions influenced)

**Insight 3: Partner Buy-In is Critical**
- **Source**: Case studies from CB Insights, AlphaSense
- **Finding**: Analyst-championed tools often fail without partner endorsement
- **Implication**: Ensure pilots include partner-level participation (not just analysts)
- **Action**: Schedule partner demo, share reports in IC meetings, collect partner testimonials

**Insight 4: Integration Trumps Standalone Tools**
- **Source**: VC tool adoption studies
