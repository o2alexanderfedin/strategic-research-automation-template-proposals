- Proposal win rate impact measured via CRM Opportunity data (before/after pilot)
- Consultant satisfaction measured via surveys (Net Promoter Score, System Usability Scale)
- Usage analytics report with key metrics (logins, searches, business cases generated, time spent)

**ROI Measurement Methodology**:

**1. Research Time Savings (Primary Metric)**

**Measurement Approach**:
- **Baseline**: Survey pilot participants in Week 1 of pilot: "How many hours per week do you spend on technology research, case study discovery, and business case development?" (expected: 15-20 hours/week)
- **During Pilot**: Time tracking via platform analytics (time spent using platform) + consultant self-reporting (weekly surveys: "How many hours did you save this week using the platform?")
- **End of Pilot**: Survey participants: "How many hours per week do you now spend on research/business case tasks?" (target: 8-12 hours/week)
- **Calculation**: (Baseline hours - Post-pilot hours) / Baseline hours = % time savings

**Target**: 30-50% time savings (industry benchmark for research automation tools)

**Expected Results**:
- **Firm 1**: 40% time savings (16 hours/week → 10 hours/week)
- **Firm 2**: 35% time savings (18 hours/week → 12 hours/week)
- **Firm 3**: 45% time savings (15 hours/week → 8 hours/week)
- **Overall Average**: 40% time savings across all pilot firms

---

**2. Proposal Velocity (Secondary Metric)**

**Measurement Approach**:
- **Baseline**: Survey participants: "How long does it typically take to create a client proposal with technology recommendations and business case?" (expected: 8-12 hours)
- **During Pilot**: Track time to create proposals using platform (from CRM sync to final export)
- **End of Pilot**: Survey participants: "How long does it now take to create proposals using the platform?" (target: 3-5 hours)
- **Calculation**: (Baseline time - Post-pilot time) / Baseline time = % velocity improvement

**Target**: 2-3x faster proposal creation (50-67% time reduction)

**Expected Results**:
- **Firm 1**: 2.5x faster (10 hours → 4 hours per proposal)
- **Firm 2**: 2x faster (12 hours → 6 hours per proposal)
- **Firm 3**: 3x faster (9 hours → 3 hours per proposal)
- **Overall Average**: 2.5x faster proposal creation

---

**3. Proposal Win Rate Impact (Tertiary Metric)**

**Measurement Approach**:
- **Baseline**: Pull CRM data for 6 months before pilot (Opportunities created, won, lost)
- **During Pilot**: Tag CRM Opportunities that used platform-generated business cases
- **Post-Pilot**: Compare win rates for "platform-assisted" proposals vs. baseline
- **Calculation**: (Platform-assisted win rate - Baseline win rate) / Baseline win rate = % win rate improvement

**Target**: 5-15% win rate improvement (realistic for tool-assisted proposals)

**Expected Results** (limited data during 8-12 week pilot, but directional):
- **Firm 1**: 30% baseline win rate → 35% platform-assisted win rate (+17% improvement)
- **Firm 2**: 25% baseline win rate → 28% platform-assisted win rate (+12% improvement)
- **Firm 3**: 40% baseline win rate (specialized CX firm) → 45% platform-assisted win rate (+12.5% improvement)
- **Overall Average**: +10-15% win rate improvement (note: small sample size during pilot, need 6-12 months for statistical significance)

---

**4. Consultant Satisfaction (Qualitative + Quantitative)**

**Measurement Approach**:
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Survey question: "How likely are you to recommend this platform to a colleague?" (0-10 scale)
  - Promoters (9-10): Love the product, will advocate
  - Passives (7-8): Satisfied but not enthusiastic
  - Detractors (0-6): Unhappy, may churn
  - **NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors** (target: 50+, world-class is 70+)
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: 10-question standardized usability survey (target: 80+, "excellent" usability)
- **Qualitative Feedback**: Open-ended survey questions and interviews
  - "What do you love most about the platform?"
  - "What frustrates you most about the platform?"
  - "What features are missing or need improvement?"

**Target**:
- NPS 50+ (indicates strong product-market fit)
- SUS 80+ (indicates excellent usability)
- 80%+ of consultants would continue using platform after pilot

**Expected Results**:
- **Firm 1**: NPS 55, SUS 82, 87% would continue (13/15 consultants)

- **NPS 54, SUS 82** (strong product-market fit and usability)
- **84% retention intent** (38/45 consultants want to continue using platform)

**Business Case for Firm-Wide Deployment** (per consultant per year):
- Time savings: 40% of 20 hours/week = 8 hours/week × 48 weeks = 384 hours/year
- Consultant billing rate: $250-$400/hour (blended rate for Senior Consultant + Engagement Manager)
- **Value created**: 384 hours × $300/hour = **$115,200 per consultant per year**
- Platform cost: $5K-$10K per user per year
- **ROI**: $115,200 / $7,500 (midpoint) = **15x ROI**

**Success Criteria**:

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Pilot Firm Commitment** | Need 2-3 firms to complete full 8-12 week pilot | Over-recruit (target 10-15 prospects to secure 2-3 commits), offer compelling incentives (50-70% discount or free pilot) |
| **Consultant Participation** | Need 80%+ active usage to measure ROI | Active onboarding and training, weekly engagement (office hours, Slack support), gamification (leaderboards, usage badges) |
| **CRM Data Access** | Need access to Opportunity data to measure win rate impact | Negotiate data sharing in pilot agreements, anonymize data to address privacy concerns, use consultant self-reporting if CRM access denied |
| **Product Stability** | MVP must be stable enough for production use (minimal bugs/downtime) | Phase 1 testing and QA, real-time monitoring (New Relic), fast incident response (<2 hours) |

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Low Adoption** | Medium | High | Proactive onboarding, weekly engagement, identify barriers early (interviews with low-usage consultants), simplify UX if complexity is barrier |
| **ROI Not Achieved** | Medium | High | Set realistic expectations (30-50% time savings achievable if consultants actively use platform), iterate quickly based on feedback, focus on high-value features (case studies, business case generator) |
| **Pilot Firm Churn** | Low | High | Weekly check-ins with pilot sponsors (Practice Leaders), address pain points fast (<1 week for critical issues), demonstrate value early (quick wins in Week 2-3) |
| **Content Quality Issues** | Medium | Medium | Manual curation for first 500 case studies, NLP validation, consultant feedback loops (flag inaccurate content), hire subject matter experts for quality review |
| **Technical Issues (Bugs, Downtime)** | Medium | High | 95%+ uptime SLA, fast incident response, proactive monitoring, fallback plans (offline export of case studies if platform down during critical proposal deadline) |
| **Competitor Awareness** | Low | Medium | Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with pilot firms, delay public case studies until Phase 3 (after competitive moat established), focus on execution speed |
