## Total Addressable Market (TAM): $1.4B-$3.2B

### Market Definition

The TAM represents the **total annual spending by global consulting firms on technology intelligence platforms, research tools, and competitive intelligence systems** used to support digital transformation advisory services.

### TAM Calculation Methodology

#### **Approach 1: Top-Down from DX Consulting Market**

| **Component** | **Value** | **Source** |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Global DX Consulting Market (2024) | $60.3B | Straits Research, 2024 |
| Research/Intelligence Component | 40-60% | Industry estimate based on consultant time allocation |
| Technology Intelligence Spend | $24.1B-$36.2B | Calculated: 40-60% of $60.3B |
| External Platform/Tool Spend | 4-8% | Estimated share of technology intelligence budget |
| **TAM Estimate (Top-Down)** | **$965M-$2.9B** | Calculated: 4-8% of $24.1B-$36.2B |

**Rationale**: DX consultants spend 40-60% of engagement time on research activities including technology landscape analysis, competitive benchmarking, vendor evaluation, and implementation case studies. Of this research budget, 4-8% is allocated to external platforms and tools (vs. internal labor costs).
