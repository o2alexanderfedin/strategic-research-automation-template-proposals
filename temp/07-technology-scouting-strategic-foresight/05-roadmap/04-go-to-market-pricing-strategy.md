## Executive Summary

The go-to-market (GTM) strategy for the AI-powered technology scouting platform leverages a **product-led growth model with enterprise sales** targeting Fortune 500-1000 Chief Innovation Officers and VPs of Innovation. The strategy is anchored on a three-tiered subscription pricing model ($60K Starter, $100K Professional, $150K+ Enterprise annual) with a structured pilot-to-paid conversion funnel that achieves 70-80% conversion rates through demonstrated ROI (340% documented in case studies).

The pricing model follows B2B SaaS best practices with transparent tiered pricing, value-based positioning (not cost-plus), and strategic discounting for pilot programs (50% off Year 1) and multi-year commitments (10-15% discount). The GTM motion combines direct outbound sales (40% of customers), strategic conference presence (30%), customer referrals (20%), and inbound content marketing (10%), achieving a blended CAC of $25K-30K with 4-8 month payback period.

This strategy positions the platform as a premium enterprise offering priced 60-70% below strategic foresight consulting ($300K-$1M per engagement from McKinsey/BCG) while delivering continuous value through subscription model. The GTM plan targets $9M-18M ARR by Month 9 and $30M-60M ARR by Year 2, with validated unit economics showing 6:1 to 15:1 LTV:CAC ratios exceeding venture capital benchmarks.

## Pricing Model: Three-Tier Subscription

### Pricing Philosophy

**Value-Based Pricing**:
- Price anchored to **customer value delivered** (time savings, missed signals identified, competitive advantage) not cost-to-serve
- Target pricing at 10-20% of customer innovation intelligence budget ($200K-500K) to ensure affordability while capturing value
- Position as **strategic investment** (not expense) with documented 340% ROI

**Tiered Pricing Benefits**:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Match pricing to company size and use case intensity (Fortune 500 pay Enterprise, mid-market pay Starter)
- **Upgrade Path**: Customers start with Starter tier, upgrade to Professional/Enterprise as usage grows (expansion revenue)
- **Anchor Effect**: Enterprise tier ($150K+) makes Professional ($100K) and Starter ($60K) appear more affordable by comparison

**Transparent Pricing**:
- **Public Pricing**: Display pricing on website (vs. "Contact Sales") builds trust and qualifies leads
- **No Custom Pricing**: Avoid one-off discounts that create pricing confusion and erode revenue integrity
- **Clear Feature Differentiation**: Each tier has distinct features to justify price premium (not arbitrary)

## Pricing Strategy: Discounts & Incentives

### Pilot Program Discounting

**Pilot Pricing (2-Month Trial)**:

| Tier | Annual Price | Pilot Price (2 months) | Discount |
|------|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $60K | $15K | 70% off monthly rate |
| **Professional** | $100K | $25K | 70% off monthly rate |
| **Enterprise** | $150K | $30K | 80% off monthly rate |

**Rationale**:
- **Commitment Signal**: $15K-30K fee ensures customer has budget authority and serious intent (vs. free trials that rarely convert)
- **Risk Mitigation**: 2-month pilot de-risks decision for customer (proof of value before annual commitment)
- **Conversion Optimization**: 70-80% of paid pilots convert to annual subscriptions (vs. 10-20% conversion for free trials)

---

### Early Bird Discount (Pilot-to-Paid Conversion)

**Offer**: 50% discount on Year 1 annual subscription for pilot customers who commit within 2 weeks of pilot completion

| Tier | Annual List Price | Early Bird Price (50% off) | Savings |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| **Starter** | $60K | $30K | $30K (50% off) |
| **Professional** | $100K | $50K | $50K (50% off) |
| **Enterprise** | $150K | $75K | $75K (50% off) |

**Additional Incentive**: 10% discount for annual pre-payment (vs. quarterly billing)

| Tier | Early Bird Quarterly | Early Bird Annual Pre-Pay | Total Savings |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Starter** | $30K (4 quarters) | $27K (10% off) | $33K (55% off list) |
| **Professional** | $50K (4 quarters) | $45K (10% off) | $55K (55% off list) |
| **Enterprise** | $75K (4 quarters) | $67.5K (10% off) | $82.5K (55% off list) |

**Expiration Policy**:
- Offer expires 2 weeks after pilot completion (creates urgency)
- Extensions considered on case-by-case basis (if customer requests 1-month pilot extension at 50% monthly rate)

**Rationale**:
- **Fast Conversion**: 2-week deadline prevents indefinite consideration and decision drift
- **Budget Accommodation**: 50% discount addresses budget objection for most customers
- **Cash Flow**: Annual pre-pay provides upfront cash for reinvestment in growth

---

### Multi-Year Contract Discounting

**Offer**: 10-15% discount for multi-year commitments (2-3 year contracts)

| Contract Length | Starter Discount | Professional Discount | Enterprise Discount |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **1 Year** | $60K (list price) | $100K (list price) | $150K (list price) |
| **2 Years** | $108K ($54K/year, 10% off) | $180K ($90K/year, 10% off) | $270K ($135K/year, 10% off) |
| **3 Years** | $153K ($51K/year, 15% off) | $255K ($85K/year, 15% off) | $382.5K ($127.5K/year, 15% off) |

**Rationale**:
- **Revenue Predictability**: Multi-year contracts de-risk revenue forecasting and reduce churn
- **Customer Commitment**: 2-3 year commitments signal high confidence in platform value
- **Reduces Acquisition Costs**: Long-term contracts reduce need for annual renewal sales efforts

**Target Mix**: 30-40% of customers on multi-year contracts by Year 2

---

### Volume Discounting (Enterprise Accounts)

**Not Offered at Launch**: Avoid volume discounting initially to establish pricing integrity

**Potential Future Consideration (Year 2+)**:
- Enterprise accounts with 100+ users or 20+ domains may negotiate custom pricing
- White-label partnerships with consulting firms priced separately (not volume discount on standard tiers)

## Pricing Packaging & Messaging

### Feature Differentiation Rationale

**Why Tier Features This Way?**:

| Feature | Starter | Professional | Enterprise | Differentiation Rationale |
|---------|---------|--------------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Domains** | 3 | 5 | Unlimited | Mid-market focuses on 3-5 core technologies; enterprises monitor 10-20+ domains |
| **Users** | 5 | 10 | Unlimited | Starter for small innovation teams; Professional for multi-functional teams; Enterprise for company-wide deployment |
| **Radar Frequency** | Monthly | Monthly | Weekly | Enterprise customers need more frequent updates for fast-moving domains (AI, quantum) |
| **Foresight Reports** | Quarterly | Quarterly | Monthly | Enterprise boards meet monthly and require frequent strategic foresight updates |
| **API Access** | None | Read-only | Full | Enterprise customers integrate with internal platforms (innovation management software, BI tools) |
| **Support** | Email | Email + Chat | Dedicated CSM | Enterprise customers require white-glove service and proactive success management |

**Avoids Common Pitfalls**:
- **No Arbitrary Limits**: Features limited by customer need (not artificial throttling to force upgrades)
- **Clear Upgrade Path**: Customers outgrow tiers naturally (add domains, users, report frequency) vs. hitting arbitrary limits
- **No Cannibalization**: Enterprise tier features (weekly radars, monthly foresight, API, CSM) justify 2.5x price premium over Starter
