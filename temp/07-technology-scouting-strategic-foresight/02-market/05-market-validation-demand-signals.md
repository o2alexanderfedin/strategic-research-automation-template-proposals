### Why Foresight Demand is Growing

**Board-Level Drivers**:

1. **Strategic Uncertainty**:
   - AI disruption across industries (ChatGPT launch in Nov 2022 created 18-month strategic uncertainty wave)
   - Geopolitical instability (supply chain resilience, de-globalization trends)
   - Climate change and energy transition (require 5-10 year scenario planning)
   - Boards demand "What's coming?" foresight for multi-billion dollar capital allocation decisions

2. **Competitive Pressure**:
   - Only 41% of Fortune Global 500 from 2000 remain (59% disappeared or fell off list)
   - Boards fear "Kodak moment" (missing industry disruption, existential business threat)
   - Foresight seen as survival necessity, not luxury

3. **Shareholder Expectations**:
   - Investors demand forward-looking strategy (not just quarterly earnings guidance)
   - ESG mandates require climate scenario planning and long-term sustainability roadmaps
