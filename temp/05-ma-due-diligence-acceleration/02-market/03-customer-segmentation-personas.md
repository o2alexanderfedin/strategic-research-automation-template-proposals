These firms generate **USD 12-18M** in annual revenue and face acute pressure to improve efficiency without sacrificing quality.

## Customer Segmentation Framework

### Segmentation Criteria

We segment the M&A advisory market by **firm size**, **deal volume**, **deal size**, and **service model** to identify the highest-value target customers.

| Segment | Firm Size (FTE) | Annual Deal Volume | Avg Deal Size | Annual Revenue | Tech Adoption | Target Priority |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Bulge Bracket** | 5,000-100,000 | 200-500+ | $1B-50B+ | $5B-15B | Build internal AI | Low (build vs. buy) |
| **Elite Boutique** | 200-1,000 | 50-150 | $500M-5B | $200M-1B | Selective buyers | Medium (selective) |
| **Mid-Market Banks** | 100-300 | 30-80 | $100M-1B | $25M-75M | Active buyers | **High Priority** |

| **Small Boutiques** | 10-50 | 5-20 | $25M-200M | $3M-10M | Limited budget | Low (insufficient scale) |

**Primary Target**: **Lower Mid-Market (50-150 FTE)** and **Mid-Market (100-300 FTE)** investment banks

**Rationale:**

- **Sufficient deal volume** (15-80 deals annually) to justify platform investment
- **Limited internal resources** for building proprietary AI solutions
- **Cost-conscious** but willing to invest in tools that demonstrably improve efficiency
- **Acute pain** from analyst turnover and client fee pressure
- **Underserved** by AI vendors focused on law firms or bulge brackets

### Geographic Segmentation

| **Rest of Europe** | 80-120 | Fragmented | Germany (Frankfurt), France (Paris), Switzerland (Zurich) | **Future** |

**Initial Geographic Focus**: United States (specifically New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles)

### Industry Vertical Segmentation

Many boutique investment banks specialize in **industry verticals**, creating opportunities for tailored research capabilities.

**High-Priority Verticals:**

| Vertical | % of Mid-Market Deals | Research Intensity | Regulatory Complexity | Example Firms |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Technology/Software** | 25-30% | Very High | Medium | FT Partners, GP Bullhound, CODE Advisors |

| **Consumer/Retail** | 8-10% | Medium-High | Low-Medium | Telsey Advisory Group |
| **Financial Services** | 8-10% | High | Very High | Fintech specialists |

- **Technical Deep Dive**: IT reviews security architecture, data handling, integration requirements
- **Reference Calls**: MD speaks with 2-3 current customers to validate claims
- **Pilot Proposal**: Negotiate 30-60 day pilot with 1-2 live deals

**Stage 4: Pilot (Weeks 13-20)**

### Average Sales Cycle

**Typical Timeline**: 6-9 months from initial contact to contract signature

**Fast-Track Scenario (3-4 months)**:

- Inbound lead from MD with acute pain (e.g., just lost 3 analysts in one quarter)
- Strong reference from peer at comparable firm
- Streamlined pilot (2-3 weeks instead of 8)
- Mid-year budget availability

**Extended Scenario (12-18 months)**:

- Cold outbound lead with low urgency
- Must wait for annual budget cycle
- Extensive pilot across multiple deals and teams

- **Average Deals per Customer**: 22 deals per year

**Customer Cohort Analysis:**

| Customer Segment | Annual Subscription | Deals per Year | Per-Deal Revenue | Total Annual Revenue |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Lower Mid-Market (50-100 FTE)** | USD 100K | 18 | USD 360K | **USD 460K** |
| **Mid-Market (100-200 FTE)** | USD 150K | 30 | USD 600K | **USD 750K** |
| **Elite Boutique (200-300 FTE)** | USD 200K | 50 | USD 1,000K | **USD 1,200K** |

**Weighted Average (Target Segment Mix):**

- 60% Lower Mid-Market: USD 460K × 60% = USD 276K
- 35% Mid-Market: USD 750K × 35% = USD 262.5K
- 5% Elite Boutique: USD 1,200K × 5% = USD 60K
- **Blended Average Annual Revenue**: USD 598.5K ≈ **USD 600K per customer**

### CLV Calculation

**Assumptions:**

- **Average Customer Lifespan**: 5.5 years
- **Annual Churn Rate**: 15% (implies 6.7 year half-life; 85% retention)
- **Gross Margin**: 75% (software platform with minimal incremental delivery costs)
- **Annual Revenue Growth**: 8% per year (as customer expands usage, more deals, higher pricing)

**CLV Formula**: CLV = (Annual Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin × Average Lifespan) / (1 + Discount Rate)^t

**Calculation**:

| Year | Annual Revenue | Gross Margin | Contribution | Discounted (10%) |
|------|----------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Year 1 | USD 600K | 75% | USD 450K | USD 409K |
| Year 2 | USD 648K | 75% | USD 486K | USD 402K |
| Year 3 | USD 700K | 75% | USD 525K | USD 394K |
| Year 4 | USD 756K | 75% | USD 567K | USD 387K |
| Year 5 | USD 816K | 75% | USD 612K | USD 380K |
| **Total CLV** | | | | **USD 1,972K** |

**Customer Lifetime Value: ~USD 2.0 million**

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis

**Sales and Marketing Cost Assumptions:**

- **Sales Team**: 1 Account Executive (AE) per 40 customers; USD 250K fully-loaded cost
- **Marketing**: USD 150K per customer acquisition (events, content, ads, tools)
- **Sales Engineering**: 0.5 SE per AE; USD 125K allocated per 40 customers
- **Total S&M Cost**: USD 525K per 40 customers = **USD 13.1K per customer**

**CAC by Channel:**

| Acquisition Channel | % of Customers | CAC | Blended CAC |
|---------------------|----------------|-----|-------------|
| **Inbound (Content/SEO)** | 30% | USD 8K | USD 2.4K |
| **Referral/Word-of-Mouth** | 25% | USD 5K | USD 1.25K |
| **Outbound (Cold)** | 25% | USD 20K | USD 5K |
| **Events/Conferences** | 15% | USD 18K | USD 2.7K |
| **Partnerships (VDR, etc.)** | 5% | USD 12K | USD 0.6K |
| **Blended Average CAC** | | | **USD 11.95K** |

**CAC Rounded: USD 12K per customer**

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | USD 1,972K | 5.5 years × USD 600K annual × 75% margin, discounted |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | USD 12K | Blended across channels |
| **CLV : CAC Ratio** | **164:1** | USD 1,972K / USD 12K |
| **Months to Payback CAC** | **0.24 months** | (USD 12K / USD 600K annual) × 12 |

**Interpretation**: Exceptional unit economics driven by high customer lifetime value, low customer acquisition costs (referral-driven growth), and strong retention. CLV:CAC ratio >3:1 is considered healthy for SaaS; 164:1 indicates highly efficient go-to-market motion once product-market fit achieved.

**Note**: Initial CAC will be higher (USD 30-50K) during market education phase; these are steady-state estimates after brand establishment and reference customer base built.
