## Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

### SAM Definition

The SAM represents the portion of TAM realistically addressable by an AI-powered due diligence research platform targeting **mid-market investment banks and boutique M&A advisory firms** (50-200 FTE) in North America.

### SAM Segmentation Criteria

**Target Customer Profile:**

- **Firm Size**: 50-200 full-time employees
- **Firm Type**: Boutique investment banks, middle-market advisory firms, elite boutiques (lower tier)
- **Deal Focus**: $50M-$500M transaction values (middle market sweet spot)
- **Geography**: Primary focus on United States and Canada
- **Service Mix**: M&A advisory with internal due diligence teams

**Exclusions from SAM:**

- Bulge bracket banks (>5,000 FTE) - build custom internal solutions
- Very small boutiques (<50 FTE) - insufficient deal volume to justify platform investment
- Pure transaction advisory firms without due diligence teams
- Non-North American firms (in initial market entry phase)

### SAM Calculation

**Step 1: Estimate Number of Target Firms**

Based on Axial's Lower Middle Market Investment Banking League Tables (2024), which reviewed **over 400 investment banks and advisory firms**, we estimate:

- **Middle Market Banks**: 150-200 firms in 50-200 FTE range
- **Elite Boutiques (Lower Tier)**: 50-75 firms
- **Specialized Industry Boutiques**: 100-150 firms
- **Total Target Firms**: **300-425 firms**

Conservative estimate: **350 firms**

**Step 2: Average Deal Volume per Firm**

- Middle market firms complete **15-30 deals per year** on average
- Average deal value: **USD 150-250 million**
- Average firm-level annual M&A revenue: **USD 10-15 million**

Conservative estimate: **USD 12 million per firm**

**Step 3: Due Diligence as % of Total Advisory**

Due diligence services typically represent **25-35%** of total M&A advisory fees, with the remainder going to transaction structuring, negotiation, and execution support.

Conservative estimate: **30% of advisory revenue**

**Step 4: SAM Calculation**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Number of target firms | 350 |
| Average annual advisory revenue per firm | USD 12M |
| Total advisory revenue (target segment) | USD 4.2B |
| Due diligence % of advisory revenue | 30% |
| **SAM (Due Diligence Addressable)** | **USD 1.26B** |

**However**, not all due diligence spend is addressable by software platforms. Traditional consulting-heavy work (interviews, site visits, negotiations) represents approximately **65-70%** of DD spend, while **research, document review, and data analysis** (software-addressable) represents **30-35%**.

**Adjusted SAM:**

- USD 1.26B × 35% (software-addressable portion) = **USD 441 million**

**Additionally**, we should include the opportunity from firms currently outsourcing DD to Big 4 consulting firms but considering insourcing with software tools:

- Estimated 200 additional firms in target size range currently outsourcing 100% of DD
- Average annual DD spend per firm: USD 500K-1M
- Addressable with insourcing + software: USD 100-200M

**Total SAM: USD 441M + USD 150M (insourcing opportunity) = USD 591 million**

**SAM Range: USD 441-750 million** (conservative to optimistic scenarios)

**SAM Consensus: USD 590 million** (mid-range estimate)
