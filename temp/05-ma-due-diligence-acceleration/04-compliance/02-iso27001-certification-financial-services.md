## ISO 27001:2022 Overview

### What is ISO 27001?

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is the international standard for **Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)**, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The standard provides requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an ISMS [ISO, 2022].

### 2022 Update

The most recent version, ISO 27001:2022, was published in October 2022 and includes:

- Updated controls (93 controls vs. 114 in 2013 version)
- Reorganized Annex A controls into 4 categories (from 14 categories)
- New controls addressing cloud security, threat intelligence, and data masking
- Enhanced risk management requirements

### Global Recognition

ISO 27001 is recognized in **170+ countries** and is the most widely adopted information security standard globally. Unlike SOC 2 (which is US-centric), ISO 27001 is the de facto standard for international business.

---

## Why ISO 27001 Matters for M&A Due Diligence Platforms

### 1. Global Client Requirements

**European Investment Banks**: Many European financial institutions require ISO 27001 certification as a prerequisite for vendor onboarding.

**Cross-Border M&A Transactions**: When handling due diligence for international deals, ISO 27001 demonstrates compliance with global information security standards.

**Regulatory Alignment**: ISO 27001 aligns with GDPR (Europe), PDPA (Singapore), LGPD (Brazil), and other international data protection regulations.

### 2. Comprehensive Risk Management

ISO 27001 requires a **risk-based approach** to information security, which is particularly relevant for M&A platforms handling:

- Confidential transaction data
- Financial models and valuations
- Competitive intelligence
- Personal data of executives and stakeholders

### 3. Competitive Differentiation

| Certification | Geographic Focus | Financial Services Adoption |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **SOC 2** | United States | 85%+ in US financial services |
| **ISO 27001** | Global | 70%+ in European financial services |
| **Both** | Global | Premium vendors serving multinational banks |

**Strategic Advantage**: Holding both SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 positions the platform as a premium, globally compliant solution.

## Key Recommendations for M&A Due Diligence Platform

### 1. Prioritize ISO 27001 if Targeting Global Clients

If the M&A platform intends to serve European investment banks or global advisory firms, **ISO 27001 should be a top priority**, potentially pursued in parallel with SOC 2.

### 2. Leverage SOC 2 Foundation

Many controls required for SOC 2 overlap with ISO 27001 Annex A controls. Organizations that have completed SOC 2 can often achieve ISO 27001 certification **3-6 months faster** by reusing documentation and evidence.

### 3. Consider Integrated GRC Platforms

Tools like **Vanta**, **Drata**, or **Secureframe** support both SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance, allowing for integrated evidence collection and reducing duplication of effort.

### 4. Engage Certification Body Early

Select an ISO 27001 certification body (e.g., BSI, SGS, LRQA) **during the gap analysis phase**. Early engagement allows the certification body to provide guidance on scope, evidence requirements, and readiness.

### 5. Plan for Long-Term ISMS Operations

ISO 27001 is not a one-time project; it requires **ongoing ISMS operations**, including:

- Monthly security metrics and KPIs
- Quarterly internal audits
- Annual management reviews
- Continuous risk assessment and treatment
- Annual surveillance audits

**Budget accordingly**: Allocate 0.5-1.0 FTE for ongoing ISMS management post-certification.
