# Implementation Roadmap Synthesis: AI-Powered Due Diligence Research Platform

**Sprint**: 05 - M&A Due Diligence Research Acceleration
**Task**: 05 - Implementation Roadmap
**Date**: 2025-11-18
**Author**: roadmap-planner skill

## Executive Summary

This synthesis document provides a high-level overview of the **24-month implementation roadmap** for launching the AI-Powered Due Diligence Research Platform targeting investment banks and M&A advisory firms. The roadmap is designed to de-risk the launch through a phased approach: product development → pilot validation → case study generation → sales launch → market expansion.

**Strategic Approach**:

- **Build credibility before scaling**: Pilot program (Months 7-9) generates case studies before sales launch (Month 13)
- **Account for long sales cycles**: Front-load product development and validation to offset 7-15 month enterprise sales cycles
- **Capital efficient growth**: $3.37M investment over 24 months → $2.04M ARR (1.65x cash-to-ARR efficiency)
- **Retention-first mindset**: Target 90%+ GRR to compound growth in Year 2+

## Critical Success Factors

### Top 5 Make-or-Break Factors

1. **Pilot Validation (Month 9)**

   - **Must achieve**: 30%+ time savings on real deals
   - **Why critical**: Without validated ROI, sales launch fails (no credibility)
   - **Mitigation**: Rigorous pilot partner selection, white-glove support

2. **SOC 2 Type II Completion (Month 16)**

   - **Must achieve**: SOC 2 Type II report completed on schedule
   - **Why critical**: 80%+ of enterprise customers require SOC 2 before production use
   - **Mitigation**: Start observation period in Month 10, hire compliance specialist

3. **Partnership Momentum (Months 13-18)**

   - **Must achieve**: 3+ strategic partnerships (Intralinks, ACG, M&A Source)
   - **Why critical**: Partnerships drive 30-40% of customer pipeline at higher close rates
   - **Mitigation**: Start partnership outreach in Month 7, dedicate Partnership Manager in Month 21

4. **Customer Retention (Months 18-24)**

   - **Must achieve**: 90%+ GRR on first cohort renewals
   - **Why critical**: Poor retention signals product-market fit issues, kills Series A prospects
   - **Mitigation**: Proactive customer success, QBRs, health scoring, expansion revenue

5. **Cash Runway Management**

   - **Must achieve**: Maintain 12+ months runway at all times
   - **Why critical**: Running out of cash = forced shutdown or down-round fundraising
   - **Mitigation**: Raise $4M-$5M seed round, aggressive cost control, revenue milestones
