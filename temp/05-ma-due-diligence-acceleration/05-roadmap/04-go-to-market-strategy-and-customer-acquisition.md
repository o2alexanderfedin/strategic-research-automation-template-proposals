|-----------|-------------|
| **Firm Size** | 10-100 professionals (25-50 sweet spot) |
| **Annual Deal Volume** | 20-50 M&A transactions per year |

## Pricing & Packaging Strategy

### Pricing Model: Pay-Per-Deal

**Rationale**:

- **Aligns with customer value**: Pay when they use it (active deal), not flat SaaS fee
- **Lower barrier to entry**: Easier to justify $12K per deal vs. $120K upfront annual fee
- **Scales with usage**: High-volume customers pay more, low-volume pay less (fair)

**Pricing Tiers**:

| Tier | Annual Deal Volume | Price per Deal | Annual Cost (est) | Target Customer |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | 1-10 deals/year | $15,000/deal | $15K-$150K | Small boutiques |
| **Professional** | 11-30 deals/year | $12,000/deal | $132K-$360K | Mid-sized advisors |
| **Enterprise** | 31-75 deals/year | $10,000/deal | $310K-$750K | Regional banks |
| **Enterprise Plus** | 76+ deals/year | Custom pricing | $800K+ | Bulge bracket (Year 2+) |

**Volume Discounts**:

- 10% discount for annual prepayment
- 15% discount for multi-year contracts (2-3 years)

**Additional Services** (Optional Add-Ons):

- **Dedicated Customer Success Manager**: $25K/year
- **Custom Integrations**: $50K-$100K one-time + $10K/year maintenance
- **White-Glove Research Support**: $5K/deal for hands-on research assistance

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) & LTV Analysis

### CAC Calculation (Year 1)

| Expense Category | Annual Cost |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Sales Team** (VP Sales + 2 AEs + 1 SDR) | $480,000 |
| **Marketing** (Manager + events + content) | $270,000 |
| **Customer Success** (2 CSMs, trial support) | $180,000 |
| **TOTAL Sales & Marketing** | **$930,000** |

**New Customers (Year 1)**: 12

**CAC**: $930,000 / 12 = **$77,500 per customer**

**Industry Benchmark** (Financial Services B2B SaaS): $14,772 (small) to $75,000+ (enterprise) [First Page Sage, 2024]

**Assessment**: CAC is high but acceptable for Year 1 (building foundation, long sales cycles)

### Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation

**Assumptions**:

- **Average ACV**: $120,000 (10 deals/year × $12K/deal)
- **Gross Margin**: 80% (typical for SaaS)
- **Customer Lifetime**: 4 years (based on 90% annual retention)
- **Expansion Revenue**: 10% year-over-year (customers do more deals)

**LTV Calculation**:

LTV = (ACV × Gross Margin × Customer Lifetime) + Expansion Revenue

LTV = ($120K × 0.80 × 4 years) + ($120K × 0.10 × 3 years) = **$384K + $36K = $420K**

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Year 1**: $420K LTV / $77.5K CAC = **5.4:1**

**Industry Benchmark**: 3:1 to 5:1 is considered healthy [OPEXEngine, 2024]

**Assessment**: Strong LTV:CAC ratio validates go-to-market strategy

### Payback Period

**Months to Recover CAC**: $77,500 / ($120,000 / 12 months) = **7.75 months**

**Industry Benchmark**: 12-18 months for enterprise SaaS

**Assessment**: Faster than benchmark (good) - assumes annual prepayment
