**Budget (6 months)**: $645,000 (includes infrastructure and tools)

---

### Phase 2: Pilot Program (Months 7-9)

**Team Size**: 9.0 FTE (6 existing + 3 new)

**New Hires**:

| Role | FTE | Hire Date | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| **Customer Success Manager** | 1.5 | Month 7, Week 1 | Dedicated pilot support (0.5 FTE per pilot partner) |

**Why 1.5 FTE CSM**:

- 2-3 pilot partners require hands-on support
- Weekly check-ins, onboarding, real-time Slack support
- Can be 2 part-time CSMs or 1 full-time + 1 contractor

**Budget (3 months)**: $112,500 (mostly CSM labor + pilot support)

---

### Phase 3: Case Study Development & Refinement (Months 10-12)

**Team Size**: 11.0 FTE (9 existing + 2 new)

**New Hires**:

| Role | FTE | Hire Date | Rationale |
|------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| **Additional Backend Engineer** | 1.0 | Month 10, Week 1 | Product refinement and Datasite integration |
| **Marketing/Content Writer** | 0.5 | Month 11, Week 1 | Case study writing, website content |
| **Compliance/Security Specialist** | 0.5 → 1.0 | Month 10 | Ramp to full-time for SOC 2 Type II prep |

**Compensation**:

- **Marketing/Content Writer** (Contractor): $7,500/month (part-time)
- **Compliance Specialist**: $150K-$180K annual (full-time)

**Budget (3 months)**: $257,500 (includes SOC 2 audit fees)

### Phase 4: Sales Launch & Initial Scale (Months 13-18)

**Team Size**: 15.0 FTE (11 existing + 4 new in Month 13)

**Organizational Chart**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["CEO/Founder"] --> B["CTO<br/>(Engineering: 5 FTE)"]
    A --> C["VP Sales<br/>(Sales: 4 FTE)"]
    A --> D["Head of Product<br/>(Product: 2 FTE)"]
    A --> E["Head of Customer Success<br/>(CS: 3 FTE)"]

    C --> F["Account Executives (2)"]

    C --> H["Marketing Manager (1)"]

    E --> I["CSMs (2)"]

    D --> J["Product Manager"]
    D --> K["Designer (0.5 FTE)"]
```

**New Hires (Month 13)**:

| Role | FTE | Compensation | Rationale |
|------|-----|--------------|-----------|
| **VP Sales / Head of Sales** | 1.0 | $180K base + 20% var = $216K | Lead sales strategy, manage AEs, close enterprise deals |
| **Account Executives (2)** | 2.0 | $120K base + 20% var = $144K ea | Run demos, trials, and close deals |
| **Sales Development Rep** | 1.0 | $70K base + 15% var = $80K | LinkedIn outbound, lead qualification, demo scheduling |
| **Marketing Manager** | 1.0 | $120K-$140K | Content, events, webinars, SEO |
| **Customer Success Manager** | +1.0 | $80K-$100K | Support paying customers (target: 1 CSM per 6-8 customers) |

**Rationale for Timing**:

- Wait until **Month 13** to hire sales team (after pilot case studies ready)
- Sales team needs credible case studies and references to sell effectively
- Hiring earlier = wasted capacity (no one to sell to without proof points)

**Expanded Team by Month 18**:

- **Sales**: VP Sales + 2 AEs + 1 SDR = 4 FTE
- **Marketing**: 1 Marketing Manager + 1 Designer (0.5 FTE) = 1.5 FTE
- **Customer Success**: 2-3 CSMs (depending on customer count)

**Budget (6 months)**: $822,000

| **Engineering** | CTO + 4 engineers | 5.0 | 26% |
| **Product** | PM + Designer | 1.5 | 8% |
