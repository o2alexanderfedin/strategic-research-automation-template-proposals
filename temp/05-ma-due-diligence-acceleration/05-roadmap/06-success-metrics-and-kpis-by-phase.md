## Executive Summary

This document defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and success metrics for each phase of the AI-Powered Due Diligence Research Platform implementation. Metrics are categorized into **Product**, **Customer**, **Financial**, and **Operational** dimensions, with specific targets aligned to each phase's objectives.

**Measurement Philosophy**:

- **Leading Indicators**: Early signals of success (usage, engagement, satisfaction)
- **Lagging Indicators**: Outcome metrics (revenue, retention, profitability)
- **North Star Metric**: **Time Saved per Deal** (directly ties to customer value proposition)

**Key Success Thresholds by Phase**:

- **Phase 1**: Product quality (90%+ AI accuracy, <5 critical bugs)
- **Phase 2**: Pilot validation (80%+ satisfaction, 30%+ time savings)
- **Phase 3**: Sales readiness (2+ case studies, SOC 2 initiated)
- **Phase 4**: Revenue growth ($720K ARR, 8-12 customers)
- **Phase 5**: Scale & retention ($2M ARR, 90%+ GRR, 25 customers)

---

## North Star Metric: Time Saved per Deal

**Definition**: Average hours saved on due diligence research phase per M&A deal, compared to manual research baseline.

**Target**: 30-50% time reduction (baseline: 40 hours → target: 20-28 hours)

**Why This Matters**:

- Directly quantifies customer ROI
- Aligns product roadmap with value delivery
- Easy to measure and validate with customers
- Drives customer renewal decisions

**Measurement Method**:

- **Baseline**: Survey customers on current research time per deal (pre-purchase)
- **Actual**: Track platform usage time + customer self-reported time savings
- **Validation**: Quarterly retrospective calls with customers

**Target by Phase**:

| Phase | Target Time Savings | Measurement Period |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Phase 2: Pilot** | 30-40% | Per pilot deal |
| **Phase 4: Launch** | 35-45% | First 3 months of customer usage |
| **Phase 5: Scale** | 40-50% | Ongoing (mature product) |

---

## Phase 5: Market Expansion & Growth Acceleration (Months 19-24)

### Growth Metrics

| Metric | Month 21 (Q3) | Month 24 (Q4) | Year 1 → Year 2 Growth |
|--------|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **New Customers (Quarterly)** | 5 | 6 | 13 net new in Year 2 |
| **Total Customers** | 18 | 25 | 108% growth |
| **ARR** | $1.32M | $2.04M | 183% growth |
| **MRR** | $110K | $170K | - |

### Retention & Expansion Metrics (CRITICAL for Scale)

| Metric | Target | Industry Benchmark | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)** | 90-95% | 91% median [SaaS Capital, 2023] | Annual |
| **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** | 105-110% | 102% median [SaaS Capital, 2023] | Annual |
| **Logo Churn Rate** | <10% annually | <5% for enterprise SaaS | Annual |
| **Expansion Revenue (% of ARR)** | 10-15% | 10-15% typical | Annual |

**Why Retention Matters**: In Year 2, **retention drives growth** more than new customer acquisition

**Example**:

- Start Year 2 with 12 customers ($1.44M ARR)
- 90% GRR = 10.8 customers retained ($1.30M ARR)
- Add 13 net new customers ($1.56M ARR)
- 5% expansion revenue = +$65K
- **End Year 2**: 25 customers, $2.91M ARR

## Metric Definitions & Calculation Methods

### Revenue Metrics

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**:

```
MRR = Sum of all monthly subscription revenue
```

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**:

```
ARR = MRR × 12
```

**Note**: For pay-per-deal model, calculate annualized based on average deal volume:

```
ARR = Number of Customers × Average Deals/Year × Price per Deal
Example: 10 customers × 10 deals/year × $12K/deal = $1.2M ARR
```

### Retention Metrics

**Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)**:

```
GRR = (Starting ARR - Churn ARR) / Starting ARR
Example: ($1.2M - $120K churn) / $1.2M = 90% GRR
```

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**:

```
NRR = (Starting ARR - Churn ARR + Expansion ARR) / Starting ARR
Example: ($1.2M - $120K + $180K expansion) / $1.2M = 105% NRR
```

### Customer Acquisition Metrics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**:

```
CAC = (Sales & Marketing Expenses) / New Customers Acquired
Example: $930K / 12 customers = $77.5K CAC
```

**Lifetime Value (LTV)**:

```
LTV = (Average ACV × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate
Example: ($120K × 0.80) / 0.10 = $960K LTV

OR (simplified):

LTV = ACV × Gross Margin × Customer Lifetime (years)
Example: $120K × 0.80 × 4 years = $384K LTV
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio**:

```
LTV:CAC = Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
Example: $384K / $77.5K = 4.95:1
```

**CAC Payback Period** (months):

```
CAC Payback = CAC / (Monthly Recurring Revenue × Gross Margin)
Example: $77.5K / ($10K MRR × 0.80) = 9.7 months
```

### Sales Efficiency Metrics

**Magic Number** (SaaS Sales Efficiency):

```
Magic Number = (Net New ARR in Quarter) / (Sales & Marketing Spend in Prior Quarter)
Example: $300K new ARR / $250K S&M spend = 1.2 Magic Number
```

**Interpretation**:

- <0.5: Sales efficiency problem, slow down hiring
- 0.5-0.75: Moderate efficiency, invest cautiously
- 0.75-1.0: Good efficiency, invest in sales growth
- >1.0: Excellent efficiency, invest aggressively
