## Pilot Partner Selection Criteria

### Target Firm Profile

|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Firm Type** | Boutique M&A advisory or regional investment bank | Mid-market focus aligns with product positioning |
| **Professional Count** | 10-50 professionals | Large enough for credible case study, small enough for fast decision-making |
| **Annual Deal Volume** | 15-30 deals/year | Sufficient volume to test platform on 2-3 deals in 90 days |
| **Average Deal Size** | $50M-$500M enterprise value | Complexity requires robust due diligence, not too large for pilot risk |

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Pilot Partner Recruitment Challenges

**Risk**: Difficulty finding 2-3 qualified firms willing to participate

**Mitigation**:

- Start outreach in Month 6 (1 month early) to allow buffer time
- Cast wider net (target 20-30 firms to get 2-3 participants)
- Offer additional incentives (e.g., 6-month free access post-pilot, executive advisory board membership)
- Leverage investor/advisor networks for warm introductions

### Risk 2: Low Pilot Engagement

**Risk**: Pilot partners sign up but don't actively use the platform

**Mitigation**:

- Weekly check-in calls (mandatory, not optional)
- Proactive outreach if usage drops below threshold (e.g., no logins for 1 week)
- Identify specific upcoming deals and schedule platform use in advance
- Provide white-glove support (e.g., "we'll run the first research query for you")

### Risk 3: Negative Feedback or Product Issues

**Risk**: Pilot reveals major product gaps or usability problems

**Mitigation**:

- Set expectations upfront that this is beta software (not production-grade)
- Prioritize critical bug fixes and feature requests during pilot (1-week SLA)
- Have engineering team on standby for rapid issue resolution
- Document all feedback and create transparent product roadmap

### Risk 4: Case Study Participation Refusal

**Risk**: Pilot partners satisfied but unwilling to participate in case studies

**Mitigation**:

- Include case study participation in pilot agreement (signed upfront)
- Offer anonymized case studies (no firm name, industry/region only)
- Provide financial incentive (e.g., $5K credit toward paid plan for public case study)
- Make it easy (we write the case study, they just review and approve)

### Risk 5: Insufficient ROI Validation

**Risk**: Unable to demonstrate clear time/cost savings

**Mitigation**:

- Establish baseline metrics before pilot (current time spent on research per deal)
- Use time-tracking tools during pilot to measure actual usage
- Conduct blind comparison (manual research vs. AI research on same company)
- Focus on qualitative value if quantitative metrics unclear (e.g., comprehensiveness, uncovering insights)
