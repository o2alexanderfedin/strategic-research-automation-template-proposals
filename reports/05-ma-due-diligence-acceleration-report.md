**Four Core Functions Applied to DD Platform:**

**GOVERN:**

- Establish AI Ethics Committee
- Define acceptable use cases (document analysis, risk flagging, report generation)
- Assign accountability for AI system performance
- Create incident response plan for AI errors

**MAP:**

- Document AI use cases and workflows
- Identify stakeholders (deal teams, compliance, clients, regulators)
- Map regulatory obligations to AI functions
- Classify data sensitivity (public, confidential, highly confidential, PII)

**MEASURE:**

- Accuracy: >95% for entity extraction (compare to human-annotated test set)
- Recall: >90% for risk identification (% of known risks detected)
- Hallucination rate: <2% (human review of sample outputs)
- Bias: <5% variance across deal types/industries

**MANAGE:**

- RAG architecture + guardrails for hallucination mitigation
- Diverse training data + bias testing
- Encryption + access controls + data minimization for privacy
- Monthly performance monitoring + quarterly retraining for model drift

#### EU AI Act (Effective August 2024)

**Classification:** Financial AI systems typically "HIGH RISK"

**Requirements for High-Risk AI:**

- **Conformity Assessment**: Third-party audit before deployment

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (Weeks 1-4):**

1. **Customer Discovery** (15-20 interviews)
   - Target: MDs and partners at mid-market investment banks
   - Validate pain points, willingness to pay, product requirements
   - Identify 3-5 early adopter prospects for pilot program

2. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**
   - Hire/contract ML engineer for architecture design
   - Prototype core RAG pipeline with public M&A data
   - Validate hallucination mitigation approach

3. **Competitive Analysis Deep Dive**
   - Interview 5-10 Kira Systems customers (via references)
   - Understand gaps in current solutions
   - Refine differentiation and positioning

4. **Funding Strategy**
   - Prepare pitch deck and financial model
   - Target venture capital firms with fintech/SaaS expertise
   - Aim for USD 2-3M seed round (18-month runway)

**Phase 1: MVP Development (Months 1-6)**

See [Implementation Roadmap](#implementation-roadmap) for detailed plan.

**Phase 2-5: Scale to Market Leadership (Months 7-36)**

Execute phased rollout: Enterprise-Ready → Scale → Market Leadership → International Expansion.

### Final Recommendation Summary

**The opportunity is clear. The timing is optimal. The risks are manageable.**

**Recommendation: STRONG GO**

Proceed with AI-powered M&A due diligence research platform targeting mid-market investment banks. Launch MVP in 2025; achieve 80-100 customers and USD 35-47M ARR by Year 5. Expected 5-year cumulative revenue: USD 125-152M.

**The window of opportunity is NOW (2025-2027). Delaying 18-24 months risks competitive encroachment and market saturation.**
