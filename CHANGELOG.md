## [3.10.0] - 2025-11-18

### Added - V2 ARCHITECTURE 🚀

Introduced **v2 GitHub Pages architecture** with separation of data and presentation layers:

- **`scripts/publish/generate-pages-data.sh`** - JSON data generator
  - Extracts sprint metadata from markdown reports
  - Generates `docs/sprints-data.json` with structured data
  - Configurable via parameters: `[output-dir] [reports-dir] [config-file]`
  - True idempotence: JSON regenerated, no regex replacement tricks
  - TAM calculation with unit conversion (B/M/K → billions)
  - Recommendation scoring: STRONG GO (≥80), GO (≥70), CONSIDER (≥60), NO GO (<60)
  - jq fallback for systems without jq installed

- **`docs/index-template.html`** - Static HTML template
  - Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no bash heredocs!)
  - Client-side data binding via fetch API
  - XSS protection with `escapeHtml()` function
  - Responsive design (CSS Grid on desktop, single column on mobile)
  - Graceful error handling with user feedback
  - Maintains v3.9.0 CSS Grid button layout fix

- **`scripts/publish/generate-pages-html.sh`** - Template copier
  - Copies static HTML template to output directory
  - Creates `.nojekyll` marker to disable Jekyll processing
  - Only needs to run once (or with --force to overwrite)

- **`scripts/publish/generate-pages-v2.sh`** - Unified workflow wrapper
  - Orchestrates data generation + HTML copy
  - Configurable via parameters: `[output-dir] [reports-dir] [config-file]`
  - Skips HTML copy if exists (use `--force` to overwrite)
  - Clear status reporting with step-by-step output

- **Comprehensive integration test suite** (`test/integration/test-generate-pages-v2.sh`)
  - 31 automated tests validating entire v2 workflow
  - Test categories:
    - JSON data generation
    - JSON schema validation (meta + sprints array)
    - Title cleanup regression tests (v3.9.0)
    - HTML template generation
    - HTML content validation (JavaScript, CSS Grid, XSS protection)
    - Complete v2 workflow (end-to-end)
    - Idempotence tests (JSON structure unchanged)
    - Special character escaping tests
  - Test artifacts automatically cleaned up on success
  - Preserved on failure for debugging

- **Migration documentation** (`docs/MIGRATION-V2.md`)
  - Step-by-step migration guide from v1 → v2
  - Architecture comparison (v1 vs v2)
  - Customization examples for both versions
  - Troubleshooting common issues (CORS, JSON syntax, caching)
  - Rollback instructions
  - Migration checklist

### Changed - Command Updates

- **Updated `/.claude/commands/publish-pages.md`** slash command
  - Documents both v1 (legacy) and v2 (recommended) architectures
  - Usage examples for both versions
  - Customization guidance for each architecture
  - Testing instructions

### Fixed

- **YAML config quote stripping** in `generate-pages-data.sh`
  - **Issue**: YAML values like `project_name: "Test Project"` were double-escaped in JSON
  - **Result**: `"project_name": ""Test Project""` (invalid JSON)
  - **Fix**: Strip both single and double quotes from extracted YAML values
  - **Lines**: 33-37 in `generate-pages-data.sh`

### Architectural Benefits

**V2 vs V1 Comparison**:

| Aspect | V1 (Legacy) | V2 (Recommended) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Idempotence** | Regex replacement (fragile) | JSON regeneration (reliable) |
| **Maintainability** | Bash heredocs (hard to edit) | Proper HTML/CSS/JS files |
| **Testability** | Integration tests only | Unit + integration tests |
| **Extensibility** | Edit bash script | Edit HTML template |
| **Type Safety** | None (bash strings) | JSON schema validation |
| **Client Features** | Limited | Filtering, sorting, search (future) |
| **HTML Editing** | No syntax highlighting | Full IDE support |
| **Debugging** | Difficult (bash heredocs) | Easy (browser DevTools) |

**Migration**: V1 remains fully supported. V2 is opt-in, not breaking.

### Compatibility

✅ **100% Backward Compatible**

- V1 (`generate-pages.sh`) continues to work unchanged
- All existing workflows, CI/CD, and scripts work as before
- V2 is additive, not a replacement

### V2 Testing

```bash
# Test v1 (legacy)
./test/integration/test-generate-pages.sh
# ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED

# Test v2 (new)
./test/integration/test-generate-pages-v2.sh
# ✓ ALL 31 TESTS PASSED - V2 Architecture Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION
```


### V2 Documentation

- Added `docs/MIGRATION-V2.md` - Complete migration guide
- Updated `.claude/commands/publish-pages.md` - Dual architecture documentation
- Enhanced CHANGELOG with v2 architecture details

### Usage

```bash
# V1 (legacy) - Still works, fully supported
./scripts/publish/generate-pages.sh

# V2 (recommended) - New architecture
./scripts/publish/generate-pages-v2.sh

# V2 with custom paths
./scripts/publish/generate-pages-v2.sh ./docs ./reports ./config/project-config.yml

# Force HTML overwrite
./scripts/publish/generate-pages-v2.sh ./docs ./reports ./config/project-config.yml --force
```

### Local Development

V2 requires a local server due to CORS restrictions on `fetch()`:

```bash
# Python 3
cd docs && python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

V1 works with `file://` protocol (no server needed).

## [3.9.0] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed - CRITICAL

Based on real-world usage, fixed 4 critical bugs that prevented proper GitHub Pages updates:

- **Issue #1: GitHub Pages generator regex patterns only matched placeholder values** (⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY)
  - **Root Cause**: Regex patterns `\$0B+` and `0/100` only matched initial values, not existing data
  - **Impact**: Running script twice failed silently - script reported success but HTML unchanged
  - **Fix**: Updated sed patterns to match ANY numeric value: `\$[0-9]+B+` and `[0-9]+/100`
  - **Validation**: Added post-update checks to detect silent failures
  - **Regression Test**: Test validates 0→3→4 sprint incremental updates

- **Issue #2: Hardcoded claude-eng paths prevented command override** (⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY)
  - **Root Cause**: `run-full.sh` had 8 hardcoded `./scripts/setup/claude-eng` references
  - **Impact**: Users couldn't override with custom Claude commands for testing
  - **Fix**: Added `CLAUDE_CMD` variable with consistent pattern across all scripts
  - **Files Fixed**: `run-full.sh` (8 refs), `test/integration/single-sprint-test.sh` (4 refs)

- **Issue #3: Redundant title prefixes in report cards** (⚠️ LOW PRIORITY - UX)
  - **Root Cause**: No title cleanup - extracted "Sprint 02:" then prepended it again
  - **Impact**: Cards showed "Sprint 02: Sprint 02: Title" (unprofessional)
  - **Fix**: Iterative sed loop removes all redundant prefixes before output
  - **Patterns Removed**: "Sprint XX:", "Strategic Report:", "Strategic Research Report:"

- **Issue #4: Button layout used flexbox causing text wrapping** (⚠️ LOW PRIORITY - UX)
  - **Root Cause**: Flexbox with `flex: 1` made 4 buttons too narrow (25% width each)
  - **Impact**: Button text wrapped, poor mobile experience, hard to click
  - **Fix**: Switched to CSS Grid with 2x2 layout (50% width each)
  - **Enhancements**: Added `white-space: nowrap`, mobile-responsive single column

### Added

- **Integration test suite for GitHub Pages generator**
  - Validates initial generation (0 → 3 sprints)
  - Validates idempotent updates (3 → 3 sprints with same data)
  - **Regression test for Issue #1** (3 → 4 sprints incremental addition)
  - Validates title cleanup (no redundant prefixes)
  - Validates button layout (CSS Grid, not Flexbox)
  - Test file: `test/integration/test-generate-pages.sh`

- **Model selection enforcement** (from v3.8.9)
  - All automation scripts now default to **Sonnet 4.5** model for optimal research quality
  - Centralized model configuration in `scripts/setup/claude-eng` wrapper
  - Environment variable override support via `CLAUDE_MODEL` (haiku, sonnet, opus)
  - Model pricing documentation in README with usage examples
  - Verbose mode displays selected model for transparency

### Changed - Scripts

- **Updated `scripts/publish/generate-pages.sh`**:
  - Idempotent regex patterns for stats updates (Lines 498-516)
  - Iterative title cleanup loop (Lines 404-418)
  - Improved score extraction to handle multiple formats (Lines 413-414)
  - CSS Grid button layout with mobile responsiveness (Lines 238-254, 307-309)
  - Added validation warnings for failed stat updates

- **Updated `scripts/run-full.sh`**:
  - Added `CLAUDE_CMD` variable (Line 8)
  - Replaced 8 hardcoded paths with `$CLAUDE_CMD`

- **Updated `test/integration/single-sprint-test.sh`**:
  - Added `CLAUDE_CMD` variable (Line 9)
  - Replaced 4 hardcoded paths with `$CLAUDE_CMD`

### Integration Testing

All fixes validated by comprehensive integration test:

```bash
bash test/integration/test-generate-pages.sh
# ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED - GitHub Pages generator is production-ready!
```


### Release Documentation

- Added detailed bug analysis based on real-world usage
- Updated README with model selection guidelines

---

## [3.8.7] - 2025-11-17

### Added - Table Formatting

- **Proper markdown table syntax enforcement**
  - Added table formatting rules to CLAUDE.md
  - Updated score-opportunity command with correct table examples
  - Enforces blank lines before/after tables for proper HTML/PDF rendering

### Problem Solved

**Before** (incorrect - renders as text):

```markdown
Scoring Summary:
| Category | Weight | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Market   | 25%    | 93.3  |
Next paragraph.
```

Result: Pipes visible as plain text in HTML/PDF exports

**After** (correct - renders as table):

```markdown
Scoring Summary:

| Category | Weight | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Market   | 25%    | 93.3  |

Next paragraph.
```
Result: Proper HTML table in exports

**Rules Enforced**:
1. Blank line before table
2. Blank line after table
3. Proper markdown syntax with pipes and dashes
4. One row per line
5. Aligned columns

**Impact**: All tables (scoring summaries, market sizing, competitive analysis) now render as proper HTML tables in exports instead of plain text.

---

## [3.8.6] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- **Mermaid diagram rendering in PDF exports**
  - PDFs now render Mermaid diagrams as embedded images instead of code blocks
  - Uses `mermaid-filter` for Pandoc conversion
  - CI/CD workflow automatically installs filter
  - Graceful fallback if filter not available (code blocks remain)

### Problem Solved

**Before**: Mermaid diagrams in PDFs appeared as raw code blocks
```
graph TB
    A[Component] --> B[Other]
```

**After**: Diagrams render as professional images in PDFs

**Installation** (for local development):
```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli mermaid-filter
```

**Impact**: All architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and visualizations now render properly in PDF exports for stakeholder presentations.

---

## [3.8.5] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- **Markdown list syntax formatting rules** - Prevents numbered lists from rendering as dense paragraphs
  - Added "Markdown List Syntax - CRITICAL" section to CLAUDE.md with examples
  - Updated solution-architect skill with proper list formatting requirements
  - Updated report-generator skill with list syntax examples

### Problem Solved

**Before** (incorrect - renders as paragraph):
```markdown
Key Decisions: 1. Item one 2. Item two 3. Item three
```
Renders as: "Key Decisions: 1. Item one 2. Item two 3. Item three"

**After** (correct - renders as list):
```markdown
**Key Decisions**:

1. **Item One**: Description
2. **Item Two**: Description
3. **Item Three**: Description
```
Renders as proper numbered list with proper spacing and formatting.

**Impact**: All architectural decisions, key findings, performance targets, and numbered content now render as scannable lists instead of dense paragraphs.

---

## [3.8.4] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

- **Removed API key requirement from CI/CD workflow**
  - Claude Code handles authentication itself on first use
  - No need to configure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret
  - Simplified workflow - less configuration required

### Rationale

GitHub Actions workflows don't need API key secrets. Claude Code CLI manages its own authentication when run, just like local development. This eliminates unnecessary configuration complexity.

---

## [3.8.3] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

- **Strategic Research Pipeline CI/CD workflow** - Complete rewrite to handle all failure modes
  - Fixed Claude CLI installation URL: `https://claude.ai/install.sh` (was: `https://install.claude.ai/cli`)
  - Added pre-flight validation: checks for research context before execution
  - Graceful skipping for template repositories (no longer fails with "Usage" error)
  - Fixed workflow triggers: only runs on context/config changes to main/develop, not on tag pushes
  - Added conditional execution: all steps skip if validation fails
  - Added config-based argument extraction for `run-complete-analysis.sh`
  - **Removed API key requirement** - Claude Code handles authentication itself on first use

### Added

- **Workflow documentation** - `.github/workflows/README.md`
  - Complete workflow architecture diagrams
  - Setup instructions for template vs production repos
  - Troubleshooting guide with common issues
  - Security and cost estimates
  - Expected behavior documentation

### Problem Solved

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Claude CLI installation failed**: DNS resolution error - wrong URL used
2. **Workflow triggered on tag pushes**: Caused failures on releases without research context
3. **Script required arguments**: Template repo has no initialized context to pass

**Solution**:
- Validates research context exists before attempting execution
- Only triggers on actual context/config file changes, not all pushes
- Gracefully skips with clear messages when prerequisites not met
- Template repositories now show: "⚠️ Template repository detected - no research context configured"
- Claude Code handles its own authentication (no API key secrets needed)

**Impact**:
- Template repositories: No more false-positive failures ✅
- Production repositories: Clear error messages when misconfigured ✅
- CI/CD pipeline: Reliable execution only when fully configured ✅

---

## [3.8.2] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- **Mermaid label quoting requirements** - Prevents diagram rendering failures
  - Added "Mermaid Label Quoting - CRITICAL" section to CLAUDE.md
  - Updated solution-architect skill with label quoting rules
  - Mandates always using double quotes for all Mermaid labels
  - Applies to node labels, edge labels, and all diagram types

### Problem Solved

Mermaid diagrams fail to render when labels contain special characters, spaces, or reserved words.

**Before** (broken):
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Market Analysis] --> B[Technical Feasibility]
    D -->|Go| E[Implementation]
```
Fails with parsing errors when labels have parentheses, quotes, colons, or reserved words.

**After** (always works):
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Market Analysis"] --> B["Technical Feasibility"]
    D -->|"Go"| E["Implementation Roadmap"]
```
Renders correctly in GitHub, HTML, and PDF.

### Quoting Rules

1. Always use double quotes: `A["Label"]` not `A[Label]`
2. Quote edge labels: `-->|"Label"|` not `-->|Label|`
3. Quote even simple labels for consistency
4. Escape internal quotes: `A["Label: \"text\""]`
5. Apply to all diagram types (flowchart, sequence, class, etc.)

### Why This Matters

- Prevents Mermaid parsing errors
- Handles special characters automatically
- Avoids reserved word conflicts
- Ensures diagrams render in all viewers
- Professional, reliable visualizations

---

## [3.8.1] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- **Text readability and formatting rules** - Comprehensive guidelines for scannable content
  - Added "Text Formatting and Readability" section to CLAUDE.md
  - Expanded formatting rules beyond tables to all dense text
  - Mandates maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph before breaking
  - Defines when to use bullets, numbered lists, paragraphs, and <br/> tags
  - Updated report-generator skill with text readability requirements

### Problem Solved

Dense paragraphs are impossible for executives to scan:

**Before**: "Mega-Trend 1: Self-Driving Labs - Market Growth: $1.32B → $3.11B, 10% CAGR - Technology Maturation: Publications increased 10x - Key Drivers: DOE investment, private sector, materials science - SRS Opportunity: Verified AI critical enabler"
(200+ words, single paragraph, unreadable)

**After**: Bullet points with clear structure:
- Market Growth: $1.32B → $3.11B, 10% CAGR
- Technology Maturation: Publications increased 10x
- Key Drivers: DOE investment, private sector, materials science
(Scannable, professional, executive-friendly)

### Guidelines Added

**General Principles**:
1. Break up dense paragraphs
2. Maximum 3-4 sentences per paragraph
3. Use visual hierarchy (headings, lists)
4. Prioritize scannability for busy executives

**When to use each format**:
- Bullet points: 3+ distinct items, features, benefits
- Numbered lists: Sequential steps, priorities, timelines
- Paragraphs: Narrative flow, 1-2 sentences, cause/effect
- <br/> tags: Table cells, headings, short related statements

---

## [3.8.0] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- **Table formatting enforcement** - Comprehensive rules for readable, professional tables
  - Added table formatting section to `CLAUDE.md` with rules and examples
  - Updated `report-generator` skill with table formatting requirements
  - Updated `market-analyst` skill with specific table examples
  - Mandates `<br/>` tags for line breaks within table cells
  - Limits tables to 3-5 columns maximum for optimal readability

### Problem Solved

Tables with many columns wrapped badly and became unreadable. Now using `<br/>` tags and limiting columns creates professional, scannable tables.

### Formatting Rules

1. Always use `<br/>` for line breaks within table cells
2. Limit tables to 3-5 columns maximum
3. Group related data in single cells with line breaks
4. Never rely on markdown line breaks in tables
5. Test table rendering in markdown viewer before finalizing


## [3.7.2] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **Sed variable expansion bug** - Fixed bash variable expansion in sed patterns
  - Changed from double quotes to single quotes with variable concatenation
  - Prevents `\\$0` in double quotes from expanding to `\$0` → `$0` (script name)
  - Bug caused: `sed: bad flag in substitute command: 'u'` on macOS
  - Error pattern was: `s/.../\./ scripts/publish/generate-pages.shB+/.../`
  - Now correctly uses: `s/...>\$0B+/.../\$'\"$total_tam_rounded\"' B+/'`

### Technical Details

**Before** (broken):
```bash
sed -i.bak "s/id=\"total-tam\">\\$0B+/id=\"total-tam\">\$$total_tam_rounded B+/" "$OUTPUT_DIR/index.html"
```
Bash expands `\\$0` → `\$0` → `./scripts/publish/generate-pages.sh`

**After** (fixed):
```bash
sed -i.bak 's/id="total-tam">\$0B+/id="total-tam">$'"$total_tam_rounded"' B+/' "$OUTPUT_DIR/index.html"
```
Single quotes protect literal `\$0`, variable concatenated outside quotes.

---

## [3.7.1] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- **Final git flow verification** - Automated git release management at end of workflow
  - Added final step in `run-full.sh` that runs: `"ensure with git flow: commit/push/release/merge/CI/CD"`
  - Executes after GitHub Pages publishing and all research is complete
  - Uses `claude-eng` wrapper to verify all work is committed, released, and merged
  - Ensures CI/CD pipeline is passing before completion
  - Includes fallback message if claude-eng wrapper not available

### Benefits

- ✅ **Complete automation** - From research to git release, fully hands-free
- ✅ **Quality assurance** - Verifies CI/CD passes before declaring success
- ✅ **Proper versioning** - Creates git releases automatically
- ✅ **Main branch sync** - Ensures develop is merged to main
- ✅ **Audit trail** - Full git history of research deliverables

### Workflow

```bash
./scripts/run-full.sh
# 1. Discover opportunities
# 2. Execute all sprints
# 3. Generate reports
# 4. Export to PDF/HTML/DOCX
# 5. Publish GitHub Pages
# 6. Commit and push
# 7. Create release ← NEW
# 8. Merge to main  ← NEW
# 9. Verify CI/CD   ← NEW
```

---

- ✅ **Version control friendly** - Text-based diagrams tracked in git
- ✅ **Professional graphics** - Scalable, interactive, responsive diagrams
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - Works automatically in HTML reports
- ✅ **Easy to maintain** - Update diagram by editing markdown code block

### Technical Details

**Landing Page**: Mermaid.js module imported at page load:
```javascript
import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
```

**HTML Reports**: Mermaid.js injected via pandoc `--include-in-header` flag during export.

**Example Usage**:

## [3.6.6] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **GitHub Pages metadata extraction** - Improved content extraction from sprint reports
  - **Description field**: Now properly extracts first paragraph content instead of markdown headings
    - Changed from rigid line offset (`tail -4 | head -1`) to smart content detection
    - Skips markdown headings (`^#`), blank lines (`^$`), and bold markers (`^\*\*`)
    - Fixes issue where `### Opportunity Overview` heading was displayed as description
  - **Industry field**: Now handles template placeholders in config files
    - Removes quotes from extracted industry value
    - Replaces `{{INDUSTRY}}` and similar Cookiecutter placeholders with default "Technology"
    - Handles cases where `project-config.yml` wasn't initialized from template

### Technical Details

**Before**:
- Description showed: `### Opportunity Overview` (markdown heading)
- Industry showed: empty or `{{INDUSTRY}}` placeholder

**After**:
- Description shows: First actual paragraph of executive summary
- Industry shows: Actual industry name or "Technology" fallback

---

## [3.6.5] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **Portable sed syntax** - Fixed GitHub Pages workflow failure in CI
  - Detect sed version (GNU vs BSD) to use correct syntax
  - Use `sed -i` (no backup) for GNU sed (Linux/GitHub Actions)
  - Use `sed -i.bak` with backup removal for BSD sed (macOS)
  - Fixes: `sed: -e expression #1, char 30: unknown option to 's'`

### Technical Details

**Error**: GitHub Pages workflow was failing with sed syntax error on Linux
**Root cause**: macOS uses BSD sed, Linux uses GNU sed with different `-i` flag syntax
**Solution**: Runtime detection with conditional sed invocation

---

## [3.6.4] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **GitHub Pages directory structure** - Pages now publish to correct directory
  - Changed OUTPUT_DIR from `docs/pages/` to `docs/` where GitHub Pages expects files
  - Added `.nojekyll` file creation to disable Jekyll processing
  - Fixed report link paths from `../reports/` to `reports/` (relative to docs/)
  - Updated `run-full.sh` to track `docs/index.html` and `docs/.nojekyll` instead of `docs/pages/`
  - Changed reports copy destination from `docs/pages/reports/` to `docs/reports/`

### Technical Details

**Before**: Files created in `docs/pages/index.html` (not published by GitHub Pages)
**After**: Files created in `docs/index.html` (published to `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`)

**Impact**: GitHub Pages will now correctly serve the landing page without manual intervention.

---

## [3.6.3] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **Sprint progress monitoring** - File counting now works correctly during execution
  - Fixed file path pattern from `temp/"${SPRINT_NUM}"-*` to `temp/sprint-"${SPRINT_NUM_PADDED}"/`
  - Added zero-padding for sprint numbers (01, 02, etc.)
  - Progress now correctly shows "X research files created" instead of "0 research files"
  - Fixed report existence check to use padded sprint numbers
  - Updated `/execute-sprint` command calls to use consistent formatting

### Technical Details

Previously showed: `Sprint 01 running... 37m 17s elapsed, 0 research files created so far`
Now shows correctly: `Sprint 01 running... 37m 17s elapsed, 25 research files created so far`

---

## [3.4.0] - 2025-11-16

### Added - Stream-JSON Parser for Animated Progress Indicators

#### Game-Changing Enhancement
Implemented **stream-json parser** that converts Claude CLI's structured event stream into human-friendly, animated progress indicators with heartbeat proving the system is alive.

#### Problem Solved
Even with unbuffered output and verbose messages, rookies still wondered "is it working?" during silent processing periods. No visual proof of activity between operations.

#### Solution
**Stream-JSON Parser** (`scripts/stream-json-parser.sh`):

**1. Animated Heartbeat**
```
⠋ Working... 3s elapsed
⠙ Working... 5s elapsed  ← Spins every 2 seconds
⠹ Working... 7s elapsed  ← Visual proof system is alive
```

**2. Tool Execution Visibility**
```
🔧 Tool: Read
   Input: {"file_path":"/path/to/file"}...
📥 Tool execution complete
```

**3. Real-Time Text Streaming**
- Word-by-word output as Claude writes
- Thinking indicators (`💭 Thinking...`)
- Response completion markers

**4. Rich Metadata**
```
✅ Task Complete
   Duration: 7s
   Tokens: 9 in / 324 out
   Cached: 20,808 tokens
   Cost: $0.117
```

**5. Graceful Fallback**
- If `jq` missing → falls back to unbuffered default output
- If parser missing → uses traditional text display
- Always works, just with less visual feedback

#### Implementation

**claude-eng wrapper** now uses:
```bash
claude --output-format stream-json \
       --include-partial-messages | stream-json-parser.sh
```

**Parser features:**
- Background heartbeat thread (spinning indicator)
- JSON event parsing with `jq`
- Colored, formatted output
- Tool execution tracking
- Duration/token/cost metrics

#### Key Benefits

1. **Never Looks Frozen**
   - Heartbeat animates every 2 seconds
   - "Working... Xs elapsed" counter increments
   - Visual proof of continuous activity

2. **Complete Transparency**
   - See exactly which tools Claude is using
   - Tool input preview (truncated)
   - Real-time response streaming

3. **Professional Output**
   - Clean, colored formatting
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Emoji indicators for context

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Requires: `jq` (JSON processor)
   - Optional: `stdbuf` (for fallback mode)
   - Automatic fallback if dependencies missing

#### Impact

**Before** (unbuffered output):
```
[Silent periods between operations]
[Rookies wonder: "Is it frozen?"]
```

**After** (stream-json parser):
```
⠋ Working... 3s elapsed
🔧 Tool: Bash
📥 Tool execution complete
Here is the output...
✅ Task Complete (7s, $0.11)
```

**Result**: Rookies have constant visual confirmation the system is working, with detailed progress at every step.

## [3.3.1] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed - Unbuffered Output for Immediate Real-Time Visibility

#### Problem
Even with verbose progress indicators, output was buffered by the system, causing delays of several seconds before rookies could see any progress. This made it appear the system was frozen.

#### Solution
Implemented comprehensive unbuffered output strategy across all automation tools:

**1. `claude-eng` wrapper**
- Uses `stdbuf -oL -eL` for line-buffered output (zero buffering delay)
- Redirects all Claude CLI output to stderr (`2>&1 >&2`) for immediate display
- Falls back gracefully if stdbuf unavailable
- Technical: Line buffering flushes on every newline, not when buffer fills

**2. `run-full.sh`**
- Wraps all `claude-eng` calls with stdbuf for unbuffered execution
- Applies stdbuf to `tee` commands (unbuffered logging to file)
- Disables terminal flow control (`stty -ixon`)
- Sets `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` environment variable

**3. Documentation**
- Updated `VERBOSITY-GUIDE.md` with unbuffered output explanation
- Documented technical approach (`stdbuf -oL -eL`)
- Added troubleshooting section

#### Impact
- ✅ **Instant output**: Every line appears immediately, not in bursts
- ✅ **No frozen appearance**: Continuous stream confirms active execution
- ✅ **Better rookie experience**: See what's happening in real-time
- ✅ **Synchronized logging**: Terminal and log file stay perfectly in sync

**Before**: Output appeared in bursts every 4-8 seconds (buffer fills)
**After**: Output appears line-by-line as it's generated (immediate)

---

## [3.3.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added - Comprehensive Verbosity and Progress Feedback for Rookie Users

#### Problem Solved
Rookie users were confused during long 2-6 hour autonomous research runs, thinking the system was frozen with no feedback or progress indicators.

#### Solution
Enhanced all automation tools with comprehensive, real-time progress feedback:

**1. Enhanced `run-full.sh`**
- **Discovery Phase**: Clear startup messages and real-time sprint creation tracking
- **Execution Phase**:
  - Heartbeat updates every 10 seconds showing elapsed time
  - Real-time file creation counts
  - Visual progress bars with sprint headers
  - Detailed completion summaries per sprint
  - Overall progress percentages (e.g., "1/3 sprints, 33% complete")
- **Export Phase**: Per-sprint export progress with success/failure indicators

**2. Improved `claude-eng` wrapper**
- Added `--verbose` flag support for detailed startup information
- Shows YOLO mode configuration (system prompt, CLI location, permissions)
- Clear "Starting autonomous research execution..." confirmation

**3. Enhanced Slash Commands**

`/execute-sprint`:
- Startup banner with full configuration details

  - Complete explanation of all progress indicators
  - Symbol legend (✓ ⏳ → 📊 🎯 etc.)
  - Monitoring techniques for long-running operations
  - Troubleshooting guide for frozen execution scenarios
  - Tips for rookie vs. experienced users

#### Impact
- ✅ **Real-time visibility**: Progress updates every 10-30 seconds
- ✅ **Tangible progress**: File creation counts updating in real-time
- ✅ **Time awareness**: Elapsed time and completion estimates
- ✅ **Status tracking**: Individual agent and sprint progress
- ✅ **User confidence**: Clear confirmation the system is actively working
