# Verbosity & Progress Feedback Guide

## Overview

The Strategic Research Automation Template includes comprehensive progress feedback to prevent confusion during long-running autonomous operations. This guide explains what feedback you'll see and what it means.

### Stream-JSON Parser for Maximum Visibility

All automation scripts now use **stream-json with intelligent parsing** to show Claude is actively working:

#### Technical Implementation
- **`--output-format stream-json`**: Structured event stream from Claude CLI
- **`--include-partial-messages`**: Word-by-word text streaming
- **Custom parser** (`scripts/stream-json-parser.sh`): Converts JSON to human-friendly output
- **Animated heartbeat**: Spinning indicator (⠋⠙⠹⠸) proves system is alive
- **Tool visibility**: See exactly which tools Claude is executing

#### What You See

**Real-Time Activity Indicators:**
```
🚀 Claude initialized
   Model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
   Session: b7558497...

⠋ Working... 3s elapsed         ← Animated heartbeat (updates every 2s)
💭 Thinking...                   ← Claude is processing
🔧 Tool: Read                    ← Tool being executed
   Input: {"file_path":"..."}
📥 Tool execution complete       ← Tool finished
📝 Response: [text streams here] ← Real-time text output
✓ Response complete

✅ Task Complete
   Duration: 7s
   Tokens: 9 in / 324 out
   Cached: 20,808 tokens
   Cost: $0.117
```

#### Key Benefits

1. **Never Looks Frozen**
   - Animated heartbeat spins every 2 seconds
   - "Working... Xs elapsed" shows continuous activity
   - Visual proof system is alive

2. **Complete Transparency**
   - See which tools Claude is using (Read, Bash, Grep, etc.)
   - Tool input preview shows what's being executed
   - Real-time text streaming as Claude writes

3. **Rich Metadata**
   - Exact duration (ms/s/m)
   - Token counts (input/output/cached)
   - Cost tracking per operation
   - Model and session identification

4. **Graceful Fallback**
   - If `jq` unavailable: falls back to unbuffered default output
   - If parser missing: uses traditional text output
   - Always works, even in minimal environments

This means you see **exactly what Claude is doing** at every moment, with proof it's actively working.

## Why Verbosity Matters

Strategic research execution can run for **2-6 hours** completely autonomous. Without detailed feedback:
- ❌ Users think the system is frozen
- ❌ Uncertainty about what's happening
- ❌ No visibility into progress
- ❌ Can't estimate completion time

With enhanced verbosity:
- ✅ Clear progress indicators every 10-30 seconds
- ✅ Real-time file creation counts
- ✅ Elapsed time and estimates
- ✅ Status of each parallel agent
- ✅ Confidence the system is working

---

## Monitoring Long-Running Operations

### Option 1: Watch the Terminal
Simply keep the terminal open and watch progress updates appear in real-time.

### Option 2: Monitor Log Files
All output is saved to timestamped log files:
```bash
# Watch log in real-time
tail -f automation-20251115-143022.log

# Check specific sections
grep "SPRINT COMPLETE" automation-20251115-143022.log
grep "Overall:" automation-20251115-143022.log
```

### Option 3: Check File Creation
Monitor research files being created:
```bash
# Count research files
find temp/ -type f | wc -l

# Watch files appear
watch -n 5 'find temp/ -type f | wc -l'

# Check reports
ls -lh reports/
```

---

## What to Expect

### Normal Behavior
- **Updates every 10-30 seconds** during active processing
- **File counts increasing** as research progresses
- **Agent completions** appearing sequentially or in parallel
- **Progress percentages climbing** steadily
- **Time estimates** that may adjust as work progresses

### Signs Everything is Working
- ✅ Regular progress updates appearing
- ✅ File counts increasing over time
- ✅ Elapsed time incrementing
- ✅ Agent status changing from "Starting" → "In Progress" → "Complete"
- ✅ Sprints transitioning through phases

### When to Be Concerned
- ⚠️ No output for more than 2 minutes
- ⚠️ Same file count for more than 5 minutes
- ⚠️ Error messages appearing repeatedly
- ⚠️ Process terminated unexpectedly

---

## Troubleshooting Frozen Execution

If the system appears frozen:

1. **Check the log file** - output may be buffered:
   ```bash
   tail -f automation-*.log
   ```

2. **Verify Claude CLI is running**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep claude
   ```

3. **Check file creation** - research may still be happening:
   ```bash
   ls -lt temp/*/
   ```

4. **Check API limits** - you may have hit rate limits:
   - Check Anthropic dashboard
   - Wait 1-2 minutes and check for resume

5. **Kill and restart** if truly frozen:
   ```bash
   pkill -f claude-eng
   # Review log to see where it stopped
   # Resume with specific sprint: /execute-sprint XX
   ```

---

## Tips for Rookies

### First-Time Users
1. **Start with 1-2 sprints** to see the flow
2. **Keep terminal visible** for first run
3. **Check progress every 5-10 minutes** initially
4. **Review log file** after completion to understand the process

### Subsequent Runs
1. **Launch and detach** - let it run in background
2. **Check progress via log file** when convenient
3. **Trust the process** - verbosity ensures you'll see if something fails

### Building Confidence
- Run a test sprint: `/execute-sprint 01`
- Watch the detailed progress output
- See files appear in `temp/` directory
- Review final report in `reports/`
- Once comfortable, run full automation

---

## Summary

Enhanced verbosity ensures rookies never wonder "Is this frozen?" The system provides:
- **Clear visual progress** with symbols and colors
- **Real-time status updates** every 10-30 seconds
- **Detailed agent activity** so you know what's happening
- **File creation counts** for tangible progress
- **Time estimates** to manage expectations
- **Completion summaries** with full statistics

**Result:** Confidence in autonomous operation, even for first-time users.
