# Task 01: Technical & Regulatory Landscape

**Sprint**: {{SPRINT_ID}} - {{SPRINT_NAME}}
**Skill**: technical-researcher
**Parallel Subtasks**: 6
**Date**: {{DATE}}

## Objective

Investigate the technical and regulatory landscape for this strategic opportunity. Identify all applicable regulations, technical standards, technology readiness, and compliance requirements.

## Research Focus Areas

### 1. Regulatory Framework
- Identify governing bodies and applicable regulations
- Research recent regulatory changes or proposed rules
- Document certification requirements
- Find regulatory precedents and case studies

### 2. Technical Standards
- Identify relevant industry standards (ISO, IEEE, ASTM, etc.)
- Research standards compliance requirements
- Document testing and validation standards
- Identify certification labs and testing facilities

### 3. Technology Assessment
- Evaluate technology readiness level (TRL 1-9)
- Identify key technical challenges and risks
- Research enabling technologies and components
- Document technology gaps and development needs

### 4. Compliance Requirements
- Map regulations to specific technical requirements
- Identify mandatory certifications
- Document testing and validation needs
- Estimate compliance timeline and costs

## Required Research Files

Create the following files in `temp/sprint-{{SPRINT_ID}}/01-technical/`:

1. **regulatory-framework.md** - Overview of applicable regulations
2. **technical-standards.md** - Relevant standards and specifications
3. **certification-pathways.md** - Certification routes and requirements
4. **technology-readiness.md** - TRL assessment and technology gaps
5. **compliance-requirements.md** - Detailed compliance criteria
6. **testing-requirements.md** - Testing and validation needs

## Quality Standards

- Each file must include Executive Summary, Key Findings, Supporting Evidence, References
- Minimum 500 words, maximum 5000 words per file
- All claims must be cited using {{CITATION_STYLE}} format
- Prioritize authoritative sources (regulations, standards documents, official publications)

## Cross-References

- Feed findings to **Task 04** (Certification & Testing Strategy)
- Inform **Task 03** (Solution Architecture) of technical constraints
- Provide **Task 05** (Implementation Roadmap) with timeline estimates
