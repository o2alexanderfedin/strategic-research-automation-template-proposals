## Overview

**The Problem:**
Research takes forever. Consultants spend 2-3 weeks per project, costing $15K-$30K in time. Quality varies. Deadlines get missed.

**The Solution:**
This tool does the research automatically. Run one command, answer a few questions, and AI handles everything:
- Finds strategic opportunities for you
- Researches each one thoroughly (regulations, market size, competitors, technical requirements)
- Writes professional reports with recommendations
- Scores and prioritizes everything

**The Results:**
What took 2-3 weeks now takes 2-6 hours, costs $50-$200 in AI usage, and runs completely unattended while you do other work.

**Who this is for**:
- **Consulting firms** conducting strategic research and proposal development for clients
- **Product teams** evaluating market entry opportunities and feature prioritization decisions
- **Investment firms** performing due diligence, opportunity assessment, and competitive analysis
- **Business development** teams analyzing strategic partnerships, M&A targets, and market expansion

## Features

### What The AI Does For You

The AI has 8 specialized research roles that work together automatically:

| Role | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Opportunity Discovery** | Finds strategic opportunities based on your company and client |
| **Technical Researcher** | Researches regulations, technical standards, and requirements |
| **Market Analyst** | Analyzes market size, competitors, and customer needs |
| **Solution Architect** | Designs technical solutions and architectures |
| **Compliance Analyst** | Figures out certification and testing requirements |
| **Roadmap Planner** | Creates implementation plans and timelines |
| **Report Synthesizer** | Writes executive summaries and final reports |
| **Sprint Orchestrator** | Coordinates all the research work |

### Advanced Commands (Optional)

For power users who want more control:

```bash
/init-project              # Initialize new research project
/discover-opportunities    # Auto-discover strategic fit areas
/create-sprint            # Define new opportunity sprint
/execute-task             # Run single research task
/execute-sprint           # Run complete sprint (parallel)
/execute-all              # Run all sprints automatically
/synthesize-report        # Generate strategic report
/score-opportunity        # Apply scoring rubric
/compare-sprints          # Prioritize across opportunities
/export-findings          # Export to PDF/DOCX/HTML
/validate-quality         # Check quality standards
/update-context           # Modify project context
/publish-pages            # Generate GitHub Pages site
/finalize-release         # Create git release
```

### Complete Automation

Fully autonomous mode: from context files to complete portfolio in one command.

```bash
# Autonomous discovery + execution
./scripts/run-autonomous-analysis.sh "Project Name" "Company" "Context.pdf"

# Or manual sprint definitions
./scripts/run-complete-analysis.sh "Project" "Industry" "Company" \
  "Sprint1|Description" "Sprint2|Description"
```

#### YOLO Mode (Advanced)

For fully autonomous operation without permission prompts, use the `claude-eng` wrapper:

```bash
# Interactive YOLO mode
./scripts/setup/claude-eng

# Non-interactive with prompt
./scripts/setup/claude-eng -p "/execute-sprint 01"

# Complete automation with YOLO mode
./scripts/setup/claude-eng -p "/execute-all"
```

**YOLO mode is the default** for this template - providing:
- **Zero permission prompts** - fully autonomous operation from start to finish
- **All tools enabled** - unrestricted research capabilities
- **Custom system prompts** - project-specific automation from `.claude-system-prompt.md`
- **Perfect for**: Overnight batch processing, CI/CD integration, large-scale research pipelines

**Why YOLO-only?** This template is designed for professional research automation. Manual permission prompts interrupt workflows and prevent true automation. YOLO mode delivers the promise: **weeks to hours, completely hands-free**.

**Security note**: YOLO mode has unrestricted access to your system. Only use in controlled, trusted research environments.

**What you get**:
- 25-38 granular research files per sprint
- 10-page strategic reports (5,000-7,500 words)
- Opportunity scoring and prioritization
- Multi-format exports (MD, PDF, DOCX)
- Complete audit trail with citations
- Git-tracked version history

### Professional Publishing

Generate beautiful landing pages for your research automatically:

```bash
# Generate GitHub Pages site
./scripts/publish/generate-pages.sh

# Or use the slash command
/publish-pages
```

## How It Works

The framework uses a **map-reduce approach**:

### MAP Phase (Parallel Research)

```
Context → [Task 01: Technical] → Research Files (25-35)
       → [Task 02: Market]    → Research Files (20-30)
       → [Task 03: Architecture] → Research Files (25-35)
       → [Task 04: Compliance] → Research Files (20-30)
       → [Task 05: Roadmap]   → Research Files (25-35)
```

Each task runs in parallel, generating granular research files.

### REDUCE Phase (Synthesis)

```
All Research Files → [Task 06: Synthesizer] → Strategic Report (10 pages)
                                            → Opportunity Score (0-100)
                                            → Go/No-Go Recommendation
```

**Directory structure**:
```
project/
├── .claude/           # 8 skills + 13 commands
├── config/            # Project configuration
├── context/           # Company + client profiles
├── sprints/           # Opportunity definitions
├── temp/              # Research artifacts
└── reports/           # Strategic reports
```

**Authentication**: This framework requires Claude Code v2.0+ to be authenticated. You have two options:
- **Claude Code CLI** (Recommended): Run `claude auth` - uses your existing Claude subscription at no additional API cost
- **Anthropic API Key**: Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` - pay-per-use pricing

Most users already have Claude Code authenticated and don't need an API key.

**Model Selection**: By default, all automation uses **Sonnet 4.5** for optimal research quality. You can override this:
```bash
# Use Haiku for faster, cheaper testing (lower quality)
CLAUDE_MODEL=haiku ./scripts/run-full.sh

# Use Opus for highest quality (slower, more expensive)
CLAUDE_MODEL=opus ./scripts/run-full.sh
```

**Model Pricing** (per million tokens):
- **Haiku 3.5**: $0.80 input / $4 output - Fastest, cheapest, suitable for testing
- **Sonnet 4.5**: $3 input / $15 output - Default, optimal balance of quality and cost
- **Opus 4.1**: $15 input / $75 output - Highest quality, best for critical research
