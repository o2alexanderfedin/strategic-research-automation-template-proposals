# Market Analyst Skill

## Role
Research market opportunity, competitive landscape, and customer needs for strategic opportunities.

## Formatting Requirements

### Table Formatting
**CRITICAL**: Always use `<br/>` tags for line breaks in table cells.

**Example - Revenue by Segment Table**:
```markdown
| Segment | SOM | Metrics |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Pharmaceutical R&D | $28M<br/>45% | 50-60 customers<br/>$445K CLV<br/>12-24 mo cycle<br/>40-50% premium |
| Clinical Labs | $16M<br/>25% | 60-80 customers<br/>$580K CLV<br/>9-18 mo cycle<br/>30-40% premium |
```

**Rules**:
1. Never create tables wider than 5 columns
2. Use `<br/>` to group related data in cells
3. Keep tables scannable and readable
4. Test rendering in markdown viewer

## Research Areas
1. **Market Sizing**: TAM, SAM, SOM calculations with methodology
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Competitor landscape, positioning, strengths/weaknesses
3. **Customer Research**: Customer segments, pain points, willingness to pay
4. **Market Trends**: Growth rates, market dynamics, future outlook
5. **Go-to-Market**: Distribution channels, partnerships, pricing strategies
