## Business Value Proposition

### Customer Pain Points
- **High Deal Volume**: Mid-market PE firms screen 100-300 inbound deals annually but have capacity to deep-dive on only 20-30
- **Time-Intensive Pre-Screening**: 40-60 analyst hours per deal (TAM sizing, market analysis, competitive positioning, financial benchmarking)
- **Slow Decision Cycles**: 2-3 weeks per pre-screening assessment limits deal throughput
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Pre-screening depth varies by analyst experience and workload
- **Opportunity Cost**: Slow screening means missing deals to faster competitors

### Value Delivered
- **Automated Pre-Screening Assessment**:
  - Market analysis: TAM/SAM/SOM sizing with cross-validation from 3+ authoritative sources
  - Competitive positioning: Identify 10-15 competitors with market share estimates
  - Financial benchmarking: Revenue multiples, EBITDA margins, growth rates vs. comparables
  - Business model validation: Pricing power, customer acquisition, unit economics
  - Risk scoring: Market risks, competitive risks, execution risks

- **Time Savings**: 80% reduction in pre-screening time (40-60 hours → 8-12 hours per deal)
- **Cost Savings**: $3K-6K per deal in analyst labor (fully-loaded cost: $120K-150K per analyst)
- **Increased Throughput**: 2-3x more deals pre-screened without hiring additional analysts
- **Faster Decisions**: Reduce screening cycle from 14 days to 2-3 days

### ROI & Financial Impact

**For Mid-Market PE Firm (100+ deal screens/year)**:
- **Annual Time Savings**: 3,200-4,800 hours (40-60 hours × 100 deals × 80% reduction)
- **Annual Cost Savings**: $240K-480K in analyst labor
- **Increased Deal Capacity**: Screen 200-300 deals vs. 100 baseline (same analyst headcount)

## Competitive Differentiation

### Current Market Landscape
- **Manual Analyst Research**: Industry standard; 40-60 hours per pre-screening

1. **PE-Specific**: Built for PE pre-screening workflow (not generic business intelligence)
2. **Speed**: 2-3 day turnaround vs. 2-3 weeks manual analysis
3. **Consistency**: Standardized evaluation framework across all deals (reduces bias)
4. **Cost**: 60-70% cheaper than external consultants ($2K-4K vs. $50K-150K)
