# Sprint 03, Task 05: Implementation Roadmap
## Corporate R&D Portfolio Intelligence

### Objective
Create comprehensive implementation roadmap with phases, milestones, resources, and risk mitigation for: AI-powered portfolio intelligence for R&D resource optimization - systematically evaluate strategic fit of R&D initiatives

### Research Questions
1. What are the implementation phases (pilot, case study, sales launch, scale)?
2. What are key milestones and decision points (pilot validation, first enterprise customer)?
3. What resources (team, budget, partnerships) are required for each phase?
4. What is the realistic timeline for each phase (3-month pilot, 6-month sales launch)?
5. What are critical risks (internal politics, long sales cycles) and mitigation strategies?
6. What are quick wins (zombie project identification) vs. long-term objectives (annual retainers)?

### Expected Deliverables
- Phased implementation roadmap (Pilot → Case Study → Sales Launch → Scale)
- Resource requirements analysis (domain experts, data scientists, sales team)
- Risk register and mitigation plans (executive sponsorship, quick wins)
- Timeline with milestones (18-month roadmap)
- Investment requirements ($500K-$2M for MVP and pilot phase)
- Partnership strategy (consulting firms, industry associations)
- Synthesis document

### Success Criteria
- Roadmap is actionable and detailed with specific phases
- Resources realistically estimated (team size, budget, partnerships)
- Risks identified with concrete mitigation strategies
- Timeline achievable with market validation checkpoints
- Quick wins identified to build momentum (1-2 obvious zombie projects in pilot)
