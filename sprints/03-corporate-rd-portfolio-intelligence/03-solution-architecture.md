# Sprint 03, Task 03: Solution Architecture Design
## Corporate R&D Portfolio Intelligence

### Objective
Design comprehensive solution architecture, technical components, and integration approach for: AI-powered portfolio intelligence for R&D resource optimization - systematically evaluate strategic fit of R&D initiatives

### Research Questions
1. What are the key system components (market intelligence, competitive analysis, scoring engine, reporting)?
2. What technologies and platforms should be used (NLP, data aggregation, visualization)?
3. How does the solution integrate with existing R&D tools (Jira, Asana, Monday.com)?
4. What are scalability and performance considerations for portfolio analysis?
5. What are deployment and infrastructure requirements (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?
6. What are security and data privacy requirements for enterprise R&D data?

### Expected Deliverables
- System architecture diagrams (data flows, component interactions)
- Component specifications (market intelligence engine, scoring framework, reporting layer)
- Technology stack recommendations (data sources, NLP, databases, APIs)
- Integration approach (R&D tools, financial systems, strategic planning)
- Scalability and performance analysis (concurrent portfolio reviews)
- Security architecture (SSO/SAML, data encryption, access controls)
- Synthesis document

### Success Criteria
- Architecture clearly documented with diagrams
- Technology choices justified with evidence
- Integration points specified for enterprise systems
- Scalability addressed for Fortune 500 portfolios
- Security requirements mapped to compliance standards
