# Sprint 02, Task 03: Solution Architecture Design
## Venture Capital Competitive Intelligence

### Objective
Design comprehensive solution architecture, technical components, and integration approach for: AI-powered competitive intelligence automation for VC investment decisions

### Research Questions
1. What are the key system components and their interactions (data aggregation, NLP/synthesis, report generation)?
2. What technologies and platforms should be used (LLMs, knowledge graphs, web scraping, APIs)?
3. How does the solution integrate with existing VC systems (Affinity CRM, Notion, deal flow tools)?
4. What are scalability and performance considerations (concurrent analyses, API rate limits)?
5. What are deployment and infrastructure requirements (cloud vs. on-premise, SaaS architecture)?
6. What are security and data privacy requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, data encryption)?

### Expected Deliverables
- System architecture diagrams and documentation (component diagrams, data flows)
- Component specifications (data ingestion, AI synthesis engine, report generator)
- Technology stack recommendations (LLM selection, database, infrastructure)
- Integration approach (CRM connectors, SSO/SAML, API design)
- Scalability and performance analysis (load testing, caching strategies)
- Synthesis document

### Success Criteria
- Architecture clearly documented with Mermaid diagrams
- Technology choices justified (build vs. buy decisions)
- Integration points specified (API contracts, authentication)
- Scalability addressed (performance benchmarks, growth projections)
