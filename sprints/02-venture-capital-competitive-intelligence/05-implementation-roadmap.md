# Sprint 02, Task 05: Implementation Roadmap
## Venture Capital Competitive Intelligence

### Objective
Create comprehensive implementation roadmap with phases, milestones, resources, and risk mitigation for: AI-powered competitive intelligence automation for VC investment decisions

### Research Questions
1. What are the implementation phases and sequencing (MVP, pilot, scale)?
2. What are key milestones and decision points (product launch, first customer, Series A fundraising)?
3. What resources (team, budget, partnerships) are required for each phase?
4. What is the realistic timeline for each phase (MVP: 4-5 weeks, pilot: 6-8 weeks, scale: 6-12 months)?
5. What are critical risks and mitigation strategies (data quality, customer acquisition, competitive response)?
6. What are quick wins vs. long-term objectives (freemium pilot vs. enterprise sales)?

### Expected Deliverables
- Phased implementation roadmap (MVP → Pilot → Scale with Gantt chart)
- Resource requirements analysis (team size, skill mix, budget by phase)
- Risk register and mitigation plans (technical, market, execution risks)
- Timeline with milestones (product, customer, revenue milestones)
- Investment requirements (seed funding, operational budget, customer acquisition cost)
- Synthesis document

### Success Criteria
- Roadmap is actionable and detailed (week-by-week for MVP, month-by-month for scale)
- Resources realistically estimated (hiring plan, budget allocation)
- Risks identified with mitigations (contingency plans for top 5 risks)
- Timeline achievable (validated against similar product launches)
