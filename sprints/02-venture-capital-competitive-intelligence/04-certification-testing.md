# Sprint 02, Task 04: Certification & Testing Strategy
## Venture Capital Competitive Intelligence

### Objective
Define certification pathway, testing requirements, and quality assurance approach for: AI-powered competitive intelligence automation for VC investment decisions

### Research Questions
1. What certifications or approvals are required (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR compliance)?
2. What testing standards must be met (accuracy benchmarks, AI explainability, data quality)?
3. What is the certification process and timeline for security/compliance certifications?
4. What documentation is required for approval (privacy policies, security audits, penetration testing)?
5. What testing infrastructure and capabilities are needed (QA automation, regression testing, A/B testing)?
6. What are costs and risks in certification process (audit fees, remediation time)?

### Expected Deliverables
- Certification pathway roadmap (SOC 2 Type II, GDPR readiness)
- Testing strategy and test plans (unit, integration, accuracy validation)
- Documentation requirements (privacy policy, DPA templates, security documentation)
- Timeline and milestone analysis (certification roadmap, testing phases)
- Cost estimates (audit fees, testing tools, security infrastructure)
- Synthesis document

### Success Criteria
- Certification path clearly defined with timeline to SOC 2 compliance
- Testing requirements specified (accuracy thresholds, test coverage targets)
- Timeline realistic and achievable (6-12 months to full certification)
- Costs estimated (budget for audits, tools, remediation)
