# Sprint 06, Task 03: Solution Architecture Design
## Digital Transformation Consulting Research Enablement

### Objective
Design comprehensive solution architecture, technical components, and integration approach for: Continuous Intelligence Platform for Digital Transformation Advisory - enable DX consultants with real-time technology intelligence, implementation benchmarking, and stakeholder-specific business cases

### Research Questions
1. What are the key system components and their interactions (technology monitoring, benchmarking database, business case generation, consultant workflow integration)?
2. What technologies and platforms should be used (web scraping, NLP, financial modeling, visualization, multi-tenant SaaS)?
3. How does the solution integrate with existing systems (CRM, SSO, document export, client portals)?
4. What are scalability and performance considerations for real-time technology tracking and 1,000+ case study aggregation?
5. What are deployment and infrastructure requirements (cloud, on-premise options, data storage)?
6. What are security and data privacy requirements (enterprise SaaS, consulting firm confidentiality, GDPR compliance)?

### Expected Deliverables
- System architecture diagrams and documentation (technology monitoring engine, benchmarking database, business case generator)
- Component specifications (500+ DX technology tracking, case study synthesis, CFO/CTO/CMO modules)
- Technology stack recommendations (APIs, NLP, visualization, SaaS infrastructure)
- Integration approach (Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, SSO/SAML)
- Scalability and performance analysis (real-time updates, consultant concurrency)
- Synthesis document

### Success Criteria
- Architecture clearly documented with diagrams
- Technology choices justified with trade-offs
- Integration points specified (CRM, SSO, export)
- Scalability addressed for 500-1,000 consultant seats
