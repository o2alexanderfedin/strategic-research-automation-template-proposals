# Sprint 06, Task 05: Implementation Roadmap
## Digital Transformation Consulting Research Enablement

### Objective
Create comprehensive implementation roadmap with phases, milestones, resources, and risk mitigation for: Continuous Intelligence Platform for Digital Transformation Advisory - enable DX consultants with real-time technology intelligence, implementation benchmarking, and stakeholder-specific business cases

### Research Questions
1. What are the implementation phases and sequencing (Product Development, Pilot Program, Case Studies, Sales Launch, Scale)?
2. What are key milestones and decision points (MVP completion, pilot results, case study publication, firm-wide deployments)?
3. What resources (team, budget, partnerships) are required for each phase?
4. What is the realistic timeline for each phase (Months 1-6 MVP, Months 5-10 Pilot, Months 10-18 Sales, Months 18-36 Scale)?
5. What are critical risks and mitigation strategies (content accuracy, technology complexity, sales cycle length, competitive response)?
6. What are quick wins vs. long-term objectives (3-5 core DX domains first, phased content expansion, international expansion)?

### Expected Deliverables
- Phased implementation roadmap (5 phases: Product Development → Pilot → Case Studies → Sales Launch → Scale)
- Resource requirements analysis (engineering team, expert review panel, sales team, customer success)
- Risk register and mitigation plans (multi-source validation, phased content expansion, pilot program ROI documentation)
- Timeline with milestones (MVP at 4-6 months, pilot results at 8-12 months, first deployments at 12-18 months)
- Investment requirements (product development, pilot program, sales/marketing, customer success infrastructure)
- Synthesis document

### Success Criteria
- Roadmap is actionable and detailed with clear phase gates
- Resources realistically estimated with team composition and budget ranges
- Risks identified with mitigations (expert review network, phased expansion, strong pilot results)
- Timeline achievable with dependencies mapped (pilot must complete before sales launch, case studies before firm-wide deployments)
