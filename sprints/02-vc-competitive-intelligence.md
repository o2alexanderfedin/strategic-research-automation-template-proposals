## Competitive Differentiation

### Current Market Landscape
- **Manual Research**: Most VCs rely on analyst research with no automation
- **Generic BI Tools**: PitchBook, Crunchbase provide raw data but no synthesis
- **Market Research Firms**: CB Insights, Gartner offer reports but not on-demand, company-specific analysis
- **AlphaSense**: Document search but no competitive intelligence synthesis

### Whitespace Identified
**No AI-powered competitive intelligence automation** designed specifically for VC investment workflows exists today.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Investment-Specific**: Built for VC diligence workflow (not generic business intelligence)
2. **Hypothesis-Driven**: Answers "Is this company differentiated?" not just "Who are the competitors?"
3. **Speed**: 24-48 hour turnaround vs. 1-2 weeks manual research
4. **Consistent Framework**: Standardized competitive assessment (reduces decision bias)
5. **Portfolio Monitoring**: Ongoing competitive threat tracking (not just one-time research)
