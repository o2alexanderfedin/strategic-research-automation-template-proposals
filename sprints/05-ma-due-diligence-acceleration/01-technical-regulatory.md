# Sprint 05, Task 01: Technical & Regulatory Landscape
## M&A Due Diligence Research Acceleration

### Objective

Research technical requirements, regulatory standards, and compliance pathways for: AI-Powered Due Diligence Research Platform for M&A Transactions - compress 1,000-2,000 hours of manual research into 150-300 hours of AI-assisted due diligence

### Research Questions

1. What are the relevant technical standards and regulations for AI-powered financial due diligence?
2. What are current compliance requirements for M&A transaction data (SOC 2, ISO 27001, financial services regulations)?
3. What NLP and document analysis technologies are most effective for due diligence research?
4. What API integration standards exist for deal management systems (Intralinks, Datasite, DealRoom)?
5. What technical risks or challenges exist in automated market analysis and competitive benchmarking?
6. What data security and confidentiality requirements must be met for handling M&A transaction data?
7. What precedents exist for AI-powered financial analysis tools receiving regulatory approval?
8. What verification and validation approaches ensure accuracy of AI-generated due diligence reports?
9. What are the requirements for multi-source data aggregation (financial databases, market research, regulatory filings)?
10. What standards exist for financial modeling and scenario planning accuracy?
