# Sprint 05, Task 03: Solution Architecture Design
## M&A Due Diligence Research Acceleration

### Objective

Design comprehensive system architecture for: AI-Powered Due Diligence Research Platform covering market analysis, competitive benchmarking, regulatory assessment, and operational analysis across 80+ evaluation criteria

### Research Questions

1. What are the core system components for automated due diligence research?
2. How should multi-source data aggregation be architected (financial databases, market research, patent databases, regulatory filings)?
3. What NLP/semantic analysis architecture is optimal for document review?
4. How should financial modeling and scenario planning modules be designed?
5. What workflow management architecture supports deal tracking and collaboration?
6. How should secure document handling be implemented (encryption, audit trails, SOC 2 compliance)?
7. What are the integration requirements with deal management systems (Intralinks, Datasite, DealRoom)?
8. How should the platform support both on-premise and cloud SaaS deployment?
9. What is the optimal architecture for generating 30-50 research files per deal?
10. What POC specifications demonstrate 75-80% time savings in research hours?

### Expected Deliverables

- High-level system architecture diagram (1 file)
- Data aggregation and validation architecture (1-2 files)
- NLP and document analysis module design (1-2 files)
- Financial modeling and scenario planning architecture (1 file)
- Workflow and collaboration system design (1 file)
- Security and compliance architecture (SOC 2, ISO 27001) (1-2 files)
- Integration architecture with deal management systems (1 file)
- POC specifications and success metrics (1 file)
- Synthesis document with architectural decisions (1 file)

### Success Criteria

- Minimum 6 research files created
- Architecture addresses all 5 core capabilities (market, competitive, regulatory, financial, operational)
- Security and compliance requirements clearly defined
- Integration points with existing M&A systems specified
- POC scope realistic and demonstrable
- Scalability considerations addressed (20-30 customers, 300+ deals/year)
