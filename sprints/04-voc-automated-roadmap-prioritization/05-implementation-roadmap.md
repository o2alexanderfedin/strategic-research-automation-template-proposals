# Sprint 04, Task 05: Implementation Roadmap
## VoC Automated Roadmap Prioritization

### Objective

Create comprehensive implementation roadmap with phases, milestones, resources, and risk mitigation for: AI-powered Voice of Customer synthesis for automated product roadmap prioritization - transform manual VoC analysis into evidence-based priority recommendations

### Research Questions

1. What are the implementation phases (MVP, Pilot, Launch, Enterprise Expansion)?
2. What are key milestones and decision points for each phase?
3. What resources (team, budget, partnerships) are required?
4. What is the realistic timeline for each phase (MVP: 6-8 weeks, Pilot: 6-12 weeks, Launch: 10-20 weeks)?
5. What are critical risks (integration complexity, data quality, competitive response, slow adoption) and mitigation strategies?
6. What are quick wins (freemium tier, integration partnerships) vs. long-term objectives?
7. What partnership opportunities exist (Productboard, ProdPad, Aha! integration marketplace)?
8. What customer acquisition strategy will drive growth (freemium, direct outreach, content marketing)?

### Expected Deliverables

- Phased implementation roadmap (MVP, Pilot, Launch, Enterprise) (2-3 files)
- Resource requirements analysis (team, budget, partnerships) (1-2 files)
- Risk register and mitigation plans (1-2 files)
