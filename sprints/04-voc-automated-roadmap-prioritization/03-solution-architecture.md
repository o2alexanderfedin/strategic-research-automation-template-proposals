# Sprint 04, Task 03: Solution Architecture Design
## VoC Automated Roadmap Prioritization

### Objective

Design comprehensive solution architecture, technical components, and integration approach for: AI-powered Voice of Customer synthesis for automated product roadmap prioritization - transform manual VoC analysis into evidence-based priority recommendations

### Research Questions

1. What are the key system components (feedback aggregation, NLP analysis, segment analysis, report generation)?
2. What technologies and platforms should be used (NLP engines, API frameworks, analytics tools)?
3. How does the solution integrate with existing PM tools (Productboard, Jira, Zendesk, Salesforce, Intercom)?
4. What are scalability and performance considerations for processing thousands of customer feedback items?
5. What are deployment options (cloud SaaS vs. on-premise for enterprise customers)?
6. What are security and data privacy requirements for handling sensitive customer feedback?
7. What is the data architecture for customer segmentation and CLV-weighted prioritization?
8. What are the AI/ML components for sentiment analysis, theme extraction, and quote discovery?

### Expected Deliverables

- System architecture diagrams and documentation (2-3 files with Mermaid diagrams)
- Component specifications (feedback aggregation, NLP, segmentation, reporting) (2-3 files)
- Technology stack recommendations (NLP engines, databases, API frameworks) (1-2 files)
- Integration approach with PM tools (API connectors, data sync) (1-2 files)
- Scalability and performance analysis (1 file)
- Security and data privacy architecture (1 file)
- Synthesis document with architecture summary (1 file)

### Success Criteria

- Architecture clearly documented with visual diagrams
- Technology choices justified with evidence
- Integration points specified for top 5 PM tools
- Scalability addressed for enterprise customers
- Security and privacy requirements met
