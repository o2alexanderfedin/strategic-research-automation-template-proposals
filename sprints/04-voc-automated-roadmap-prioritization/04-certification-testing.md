# Sprint 04, Task 04: Certification & Testing Strategy
## VoC Automated Roadmap Prioritization

### Objective

Define certification pathway, testing requirements, and quality assurance approach for: AI-powered Voice of Customer synthesis for automated product roadmap prioritization - transform manual VoC analysis into evidence-based priority recommendations

### Research Questions

1. What certifications or compliance frameworks are required (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA)?
2. What testing standards must be met for AI accuracy and reliability?
3. What is the certification process and timeline for data privacy compliance?
4. What documentation is required for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 approval?
5. What testing infrastructure and capabilities are needed (NLP accuracy, integration testing, security testing)?
6. What are costs and risks in certification process?
7. What quality assurance processes ensure accurate VoC analysis and prioritization recommendations?
8. What validation approaches verify the correctness of AI-generated insights?

### Expected Deliverables
